"Today I ordered food from Petoo ..to my surprise the food was very tasty n well packaged. I had ordered food from Box9 earlier but didn't like the food. We ordered Andhra Biriyani, Kashmiri Rice n some Pesto rice dish.. Biriyani was good with two big pieces of chicken n top of that few chunks of chicken with gravy.. The meat is cooked properly n the taste is good..Rest of other two dishes are equally good .. Butter chicken gravy was very tasty n well balanced with masala. All dishes came with tasty jamun.Overall a good n satisfied meal..",3.5

Worst Quality never seen before where complete stale food is delivered for people using first time offers. Also your customer care team is so careless that even when we tried reaching you regarding this issue they are trying to ignore it & taken as a joke. Team simply told it wont happen again & no solutions at all. I prefer food inspector visit for your resturant asap as two times i have faced this issue of stale food from petoo from ST Bed Layout branch,1.0

"Found this place online recently, Really great place to order food from. They've got some nice wombo combos to pick from, fair portions too. I would, however, suggest more options besides paneer related foods in veg. side. Helps reduce monotony in taste. Some extra, simply 'beverages', like nimbu paani, etc, would be sweet, too. Dank shi makes me thirstayyy.",4.0

Each box came with some curd/pakoda and gulabjamun and tissue paper and plastic cutlery. The boxes were surely worth 220 Rs each. Chicken was all boneless and very soft. The best thing was that spice level was perfect for my preference. Rice was a bit tough compared to what we cook at home, but at par with regular restaurants.",5.0

Jus got it home delivered today. I have never rated a restaurant below 3 I believe because I assess based on several criteria. Petoo is definitely below par in quality and taste. For the price that they have put up it does not do justice at all. Highly worthless. I had 3 items delivered. Hyderabadi Paneer biriyani. Non veg platter. Hyderabadi chicken biriyani.. All of them were equally bad. They must be having a poor chef! They have requested me to rate them in zomato too! I pity them. Guys don't even try choosing them even if they give u for free!,1.0

Have not tried the biryani but the Non veg platter and Pulao meals which come with veg or non veg gravy options are quite decent. The quantity and quality of rice which they give is very good. There have been times when I have ordered a few veg meals like amritsari paneer combo and it was extremely disappointing. But except that one time whatever I have ordered till now has been quite satisfactory. Really love the way the food is packaged and the good thing is that they have improved the packaging even more. Gulab jamuns are always awesome. But I throw away the dahi vada almost everytime! Its just not good enough. They really need to improve the quality of the dahi vada. But thats not a deal breaker for me. I will keep ordering from petoo whenever I need food quickly as long as they keep the quality and improve in areas where they are lacking.",4.0

"One factor which differentiates Petoo from other Restaurants is the ""Quality"". I have ordered multiple times with Petoo and I must say that food was very tasty. I am sure the ingredients used must be of a very good quality because of which the overall dish turns out to be awesome. I really didn't feel heavy in the stomach, which we generally feel after having hotel food, on all the occasions. Also the usage of oil is very optimum. Oily and rich food is something not liked by most health conscious people and food at Petoo meets the expectation in that regard. The service is also very good and fast and I received my order in around 30 min time. There are a few things which needs attention like:",4.5

"I had placed an order based on the coupon code with Rs 400 off on Rs 500 order some days back . Since there was no option to place order for 2 packs of Jamun, I was forced to place order for a hyderbadi paneer biryani. The order was executed in less than an hour. One receiving the order the shock of my life was that biryani was stale and rotten. It was stinking and sticky. Called up immediately call center there was no response then pinged on the chat box. With lot of discussion it was accepted by the company to replace the dish. This finally ended up buying a thumps up and samosa for combined price less than the price of the original dish of biryani. My assumption though is that what is being promoted as coupon based orders are nothing but pushing out previous days remains. Perhaps somebody with similar experience can endorse the assumption into conviction. For now no more orders with them that too on coupons is absolute ""NO"". I wish there was a mechanism in place to book a complaint against such unscrupulous activities that can end up hapless customers into deep health hazards",1.0

"Ordered chicken tikka biriyani from petoo for a small party with friends and colleagues. The food was smoking good and the quantity was more than sufficient for one person. We landed up keeping some boxes unfinished. Food delivery , though, took more than thirty minutes to deliver...",5.0
I had ordered Chicken Tikka Biriyani through Petoo. The quantity was pretty good for one person. They had given quite a few number of chicken pieces which were quite soft and spicy. Plus I got my food delivered hot within 30 minutes.,4.0
This place is a blend of good food and good taste. They have good options of biryani and combos and not too heavy on pocket.,5.0
The food was yummy specially Kashmeeri petoo and banarasi poori. The reason I am rating it with 4.5 is the delivery time and also for its very limited menu. Petoo is a saviour.,4.0
"Good food especially for vegetarian, normally for a non-veg the taste and variety is almost same in that price range but I liked the taste and variety they serve for veg which is a good news, the paneer tikka was well marinated and veg kofta was delicious and well prepared the gulab jamuns were soft and tasty as well.. Keep it up Petoo :)",4.5

I had ordered almost every non veg petoo box. The tikka biriyani is fine but the gravy is not that good.In kashmiri petoo and others the quantity of rice is not good enough for one person. In some of the petoo box the quantity of chickens are also very less.The UI is pathetic. Due to technical glitch my payment got processed but the amount is not returned to my account even after 7 days. The operation department should be more effective.,2.0

Order from this place only if you receive any good offers... Otherwise it would be a waste of money... All their items are priced at 190rs but you will get quality and taste hardly worth 90rs... Also be prepared to wait endless hours without a way to reach their customer care... Send them mails to check status... They will call u back in 3 - 4 hours and enquire if we had a pleasant experience and would initiate an investigation. They send u a message with the name of delivery person and phone number.. Later u will realize that the phone number is customer care number and the name is some random name.. Somebody else comes to deliver food... Only good part is the packing which anyone in this business provides these days.,1.0

After 15 minutes (around 9:30 PM yesterday) they called me and said there is no power in their outlet and so¬†they can't deliver it hot as paneer items are kept in the refrigerator. Also he said If I can wait they will deliver it hot after an hour (may be after we go to sleep :-)), and look like he is very sure that he will get the power within an hour.

Why the hell they take order and confirm when they cant deliver it. I cant find another delivery hotel at this time and am dying of hunger from past two hours. I agree that they may have some logistical problems but taking a call or calling backing and informing the status of the order is a minimum courtesy that an online ordering site should have. Who will behave arrogantly with customers will perish soon and same is the case with petoo.. I lost time, and i lost money in order and i am sure that i wont receive the money back too.. but above that i lost trust on their site and brand and would recommend everyone to avoid this site even after giving 100% discount because, they wont deliver it.

"Ordered egg briyani online the delivery was on time. Packing was compact and really good. Taste is nothing much to write about just an average, also the quantity was not sufficient for 1 person. Can try sometime overall an okay experience.",3.0
"Ordered from them thinking that we would get something new or different to taste. And yeah ! Very different indeed! Very tasteless, insipid, dry...basically not Biryani at all. It is an Easy AVOID ! Especially if you know what Biryani is like!",1.0
The food what we ordered was awesome .. Authentic taste and pretty hygienic packing followed by a faster delivery . can't expect anything more than that on a lazy Sunday morning. Writing this review for kamanahali petoo ...,5.0
Highly overpriced.,1.0
Ordered online and the food both veg and non veg was pretty good.. Very very pocket friendly and the Amritsari Platter is amazing,4.0
"Ordered dinner from here when I was craving for some North Indian food. We ordered Chicken Tikka, Chicken Do Pyaaza and Butter Chicken through the Zomato Online Order. It was quite far from my place, and the delivery took some time. But the owner/delivery person was very sweet and I think dining at this place would be a good experience.",3.0
Pleasant experience with the restaurant with online order facility(in Yelahanka). Nice preparation.. vegetarian food is pretty delicious.. homely cooking.. can go for it,4.0
"I found a bug in the food, Also instead of gobi manchurian fry they gave me gravy. Zomato should check the quality of food before they get any restaurant on board. I dont think I will take any risk of ordering food from zomota and petoo.",1.0
"We ordered from here today and were pretty pleased. The prices are affordable and the food is very palatable. Even though some portions were a little small- like the peas pulao, they were good. We ordered lunch and they didn't have biryani. A few dishes need to be ordered 3 hours prior. Also, they only have laccha paratha. No rotis.",3.5
"Loved the food. Especially Paneer Pakoda. I ordered for a home delivery and the food was hot when it arrived. Although, it did take an hour to get delivered. But the food was worth it. Good taste.",4.0
"Horrible experience. Today we ordered through Zomato. I totally forgot that I had ordered from this place a few months back and experience back then was not great. Today's experience was even worse. We ordered at 9.15 pm and delivery time was conveyed as 10.05 pm. 10-15 minutes delay is not an issue but the food finally got delivered at 11pm, that too after 2 phone calls. In fact we did not receive our original order. We had ordered Mocha Ghanto and Paneer Pakoda which were unavailable. Funny thing is although order was placed at 9.15, restaurant called us at 9.55 to convey the unavailability. What was happening for 40 minutes then??",1.0
Totally unreliable service..  Placed my order at 8:05pm... Estimated delivery 8:50pm...  It's 9:55pm and no idea if I'm gonna get dinner tonight..called twice already and it's still getting ready.. Very unprofessional.,1.0
"Went there expecting to have dinner, but realised its a home delivery place and it really does not have a place to sit and eat. Reaching there was a bitter experience as the shortcut is dark, muddy and shady..but I guess locale is not something that can be used to judge a food joint. Service is quite prompt and the managers are EXTREMELY friendly..they gave our order high priority as we had to come back early. For food, we had laccha paratha, chicken masala and chicken bharta. Quality is not something that I would gripe with but chicken bharta was not what I expected. The general notion of shredded chicken is not here and its just small pieces. The gravy for the two chicken items did not taste particularly different. Recommended if you have a sudden craving for home cooked food on a rainy day.",2.5
Really yummy food. Things as simple as mix veg korma tasted heavenly.,4.0
"I have been here 3-4 times now and love this place. If you are looking for yummy,delicious Indian cuisines you must visit this place. I am a vegetarian and tried most of the dishes and my favorite dish out there is paneer kadai and baby corn Manchurian. My friends had non-veg that is fish fingers, chicken pakoda and were also very delighted.  As the name says Petoo...it will leave you wanting for more..prices are very reasonable.",5.0
"Petoo!! Glad I found this place! Great taste. Gives a feel of home made food. If you are working and don't have time to cook, you can just order, sit back and relax. Great food will be at your doorstep!",5.0
Ever craved for a magnificent roll that would remind you of a Delhi or Kolkata? Or Chicken Pakoda and Fish fingers to accompany that Scotch you wanna enjoy. I have been eating from this small place tucked away in a corner close to Allalasandra lake and have been wonderfully delighted. Its one of the place where you just cudn't stop yourself coming back again and again.,5.0
Great  taste! Worth  eating  and bringing  friends along.  Call them  in advance  if petoo  is on your way and food  is ready  when  you  reach  there.,5.0

"food is something what can bring peace in you and it's been proven in so many occasions in people's lives... guys,i love travelling and i do it quite often in different parts of the country and with this travelling,i love to please my taste buds... days back,during my travel in Bangalore,i heard about a food joint named PETOO which has been so popular among foodies because of it's delicious north Indian,Chinese,Bengali dishes and more...i reached the place which was at Yelahanka and was very far from my place where i was staying...but but but,travelling and foods,my two loves never allow my pocket to have some fun...i rushed the place and met some warm and friendly people who welcomed me and listened to me while my foods were getting ready...all foods including Calcutta style egg-chicken roll was too tasty...i took away biriyani and believe me,it was that taste i was always looking for... i stayed in B'lore for 5days during my last visit n trust me,i could not restrict myself from visiting PETOO at Yelahanka... i suggest all the B'lore people who are staying close to PETOO and who are staying far from the place and also who are gonna explore the Garden city of India from other parts of the country,make PETOO your food destination because of the PETOO PEOPLE, HYGIENIC ENVIRONMENT, TASTE OF THE FOODS AND PRICE...i'm happy to have the realization that your taste buds gonna bless you very soon once you reach PETOO at Yelahanka...THANK YOU BENGALURU AND PETOO.",5.0
Awesome food..great service..there are plenty of good choices in menu...must try their biriyani and bengali flavours....Petoo has never disappointed my taste buds !!,5.0
The other day i decided to order some fried prawns along with an egg chickem roll and mushroom chilly. On the phone i was greeted by a very friendly person who informed me about the timings. I ordered the stuff and it reached me well on time.,3.0
Great food. People visiting Petoo should definitely try out the Chinese items on offer there. However did not like the rolls much as it was not the same you would expect a Kolkata kaati roll to be like. Overall its would be a fine experience for anyone visiting Petoo.,4.0
Tried the Chicken Biriyani & Chicken Bharta... Biriyani was quite good however a bit on the greasier side however quite tasty..the biriyani however was overpowered with Kewra Water .. Chicken Bharta was a pure washout ... This is not how a chicken bharta is made;  and I could not make out what this concoction was about ... Hence had to pass it to someone else to do justice ! Not quite an interesting affair at Petoo ..,2.5
"A perfect place to go if you crave for some Chinese, Indian or Bengali food. You wont come back disappointed. My personal favorites out of the many are the mixed non-veg fried rice, chicken biriyani and the chicken rolls.",5.0

If you visti Petoo dont miss to try the Paneer Roll and Veg Biriyani. Amazing taste and reasonable. Most important factor its hygiene and has perfect blend of flavours. Shows the experience of chef and quality of food :) ¬† Yummyy :),5.0
"I'm in Bangalore for the past 1 month and have tried most of the restaurants in and around yelahanka, but the biggest problem that I noticed was with gravy items and almost all having the same odd taste.",5.0

"Yesterday's rain I thought would play a spoil sport on my dinner delivery from freshmenu.  But apparently it didn't.  I ordered by around 9:50 pm and 10pm it started to pour down heavily.  At 10:20 the delivery agent Mr.Hemanth from freshmenu calls me and asks for location.  I tell him dude it's raining heavily you can cancel the order and don't deliver.  But he said Sir it's not right to cancel I shall deliver it give me half an hours time.  That guy calls me again in 15 mins and says sir I'm at your apartment parking pls come down to collect.  I was in awe seeing him fully wet. I asked him why did you have to take so much trouble only one thing he said "" this is my job I shall do full justice to him""  kudos to you hemanth.  Thank you freshmenu",5.0
Freshmenu undoubtedly provides great quality food but I personally feel that the taste of the food is diminishing day by day.,2.5
"My everyday night saviour.. They have an amazing idea of - as the name suggests - Fresh menu everyday. The items do repeat after some days (obviously). The menu has main meals, sides, soups, both in veg and non veg categories, and desserts and a few drinks. For its price the food is really good and the delivery is also pretty fast.",4.0
"I've ordered from Freshmenu several times before and have been utterly satisfied with their flavours, quantity and prompt delivery. However, I was quite disappointed with my last order.",2.5

"Never disappointed with the quality and portion of the food. Always exceeds expectations and delivered fresh and hot. Since its also close to my place, I get it in about 20 mins. And hey, they give you real fork which you can actually use unlike other food-tech startups which gives fork-cum-spoon. Really? Small things matter!",5.0
Their Menu is very good. The salads are exceptional with very good quality vegies and dressings. The wraps are soft and yummy. The paneer is fresh and tastes ecstatic! The Thai curries are very balanced and tasty. The breakfast platters i have had were all very good. The sandwiches are made from fresh in-house breadb that is baked to  perfection. The desserts are extremely tasty too. The mousse of all the varieties i have had were unforgettably tasty. Love the freshness and variety.,4.5
Using fresh menu almost for a year now.  The go to guys when I'm hungry and lazy to go out.  Their menu is brilliant and quite affordable compared to the restaurant prices for those dishes.,3.0
Excellent delivery,5.0
As same suggests the items were really fresh. I loved the fresh broccoli soup we tried and also the salad is worth a mention. Nice place to have healthy and fresh food,4.0
"This place is known for its fresh dishes, right from their soups to their salads. We were craving for some hot soup and that's when we chose to order from FreshMenu, we ordered ""Broccoli Corn Soup"" and ""Burmese Khao Suey Soup"" both were delivered before estimated time and HOT, it was very well packed as well. It tasted extremely good, both were top class with good amount of vegetables and amazing taste. Their pricing is very very economical for the quality and quantity they deliver. They are just amazing, highly recommend this place for Healthy and Tasty Home Delivery.",4.5
"Wow! My aunt usually says- when it is presented well, it will taste well too. Yes, it is. We selected Dumplings in black pepper sauce  (veg), Cumin-chicken drumsticks with rice (non veg), Choco duet mousse. Cost us 520. Fair enough. Tasted fresh, though a bit bland (it is supposed to be so, it seems). Good enough for two 'not so hungry-but want the best food' people.",4.0
Awesome food ... Especially the chocolate duet mousse.. The freshness of the vegetables used in preparing food enriches the taste and experience.. Became a regular at this place....,5.0

"Been a 6 months old customer. these ppl are good in what they do. 7/10 times the food is great but still sometimes disappointing. I mean its not like the food is cheap, believe me, they are expensive but at least try to match what you ppl display on your website. i know all restaurants do this but this time i was so disappointed that i actually took a pic, merged with the website pic and uploaded it here.",2.5
"My first ever order with FreshMenu last night consisting of Vegetable Dumplings with Rice (Veg), Smoked Zucchini and Pesto Sandwich (Veg) and Rosemary and Dark Chocolate Cake (Eggless) was awesome!",4.5

"I have tried fresh menu several times now, and I can say they don't disappoint.",4.5
Wow what did I experience just now.. Was I flying on flight having dinner... Well no.. That's the feeling generated after trying freshmenu.com.. Wanted to try this for a long time and the 30% offer couldn't resist me to order and try it.. The app was super easy and love it.. The concept of changing the menu daily is cool idea too.. The menu had pictures of all items helping what and how you get making choice easy.. Deliver was super fast and on time.. An additional dish was delivered as complimentary but was nonveg and was sad to return it back.. Packing was super and attractive but is it really required so much wasting paper board and plastic containers making cost higher to customer.. I am really impressed with the concept and it's really very attractive..,3.5
"Top notch chefs, their dishes always suit my taste buds perfectly. Service and delivery times are also good for most part. They should attempt to find packaging that uses less plastic though, or maybe even better quality plastic containers that can be safely reused rather than discarded after one use. I wouldn't mind paying 5-10 rupees extra for that!",3.5
Great first experience with FreshMenu. Ordered just one particular item (Baked Chimichanga) and it was great. We usually see photos of the food and then are disappointed when it actually arrives but not the case with FreshMenu. Food was just as yummy as it was shown and customer interaction is very courteous and great service overall. Definitely one of my regular ordering spots now.,5.0
"I was not satisfied with my second order from Freshmenu. I ordered a non-veg food and it was not much delicious as I was expected. I also left them the feedback about the food. However, I am happy the way they care their customers. As soon as I left the feedback, they have reviewed it seriously and they called me up to know why I am not satisfied. They have ensured me that they will work on that and prepare the food more delicious. The impressed part is that the chef itself called me and took my feedback seriously. He also delivered the complimentary food to me. ¬†I am giving good ratings only because of their customer service. Looking forward to order¬†again!!!",4.5

"Had todays special of lemongrass oriental grill fish.  Food delivered  in 30 min  was nt that hot though. Tatse was good , ingredients were fresh and quantity  was enough for a person, very filling infact. Since I took combo there was lemon parline choux bun which was yum. The packaging  was impressive but absence of fork and spoon was a little  disappointing but came to know that we need to ask the delivery  boy. The  dishes were accompanied  with salad and gravy even they were nice found zucchini, broccoli which  were fresh. The fish was basa grilled  with green paste which was mildly flavoured and also less spicy.  Happy but will I order again..",3.5

Broccoli, walnuts avocado in the mains n salads for that price is great. Apart from the first time when the guy fumbled with the address, delivery has always been within 40 mins. I've only ordered mains don't know how the other stuff tastes.",4.5

I have been ordering from FreshMenu for past one month and they have always been up to my expectations . 90% of the time Delivery is on time and even if it is suppose to be late due to some reason delivery guys have informed me earlier . Chef Nasir of Banashankari Kitchen has magic in his hand . It's like he does magic with foods . when ever you feel like eating some thing good just open the app and order . Food quality and quantity both are up to the mark it's really Worth .,4.5

"This is the second time I'm placing an order from the banshankari kitchen. Both times the delivery experience has been great. The executives are very cordial. Food options is a delectable mix. And tastes even better than it looks. If you're a newbie wondering if it's a good option, il say try it and you won't regret it. The salads, appetisers and the entr√©e are worth your money. Only reason I'm not giving them a 5/5 is because they don't deliver in chamrajpet. Otherwise kudos to you! Keep up the great work!",4.5

"Hideous. Ordered 'Southwest Ranch Sliders'.. it was terrible. There's nothing gourmet about it. Took a bite of each burger and dumped it in a bin. The under sides of the burgers tasted burnt, there were two different patties - could taste nothing but potatoes, no seasoning at all. There was absolutely no flavor - let alone a good balance of it. And it's supposed to be served with potato wedges. Urgh. The worst potato wedges ever. Even their undersides were burnt and absolutely no flavor. Imagine baking a raw potato. You have to at least season it with some salt!",1.5
They have an amazing menu with varieties of dishes everyday. The display of the food items on the app is perfect.,2.0
"Had ordered Veg combo from FreshMenu yesterday, typical of any desi wanting more for less. I must say, i was bowled over by the offering. Not only was it fresh, it was tasty too. The  CRESPELLE ALLA FIORENTINA (VEG) was just amazing and so was the GOOEY BROWNIE TRUFFLE (EGGLESS). The VEGGIES & BAMBOO SHOOT IN CHILI BEAN SAUCE WITH NOODLES (VEG) could have been better, a bit pungent for the sauce. However, the concept is appealing with local kitchens and select & short menu everyday. Should be an obvious choice for the lazy like me who wish to have restaurant like food  at home and also for pregnant women who wish to have yummy food, but cannot move around much. Hope they maintain the standards consistently.",3.5
After a long long wait freshmenu is finally at banashankari and it's just relieving that I don't have to rely on fast food restaurants anymore to satisfy my growling tummy. Relieved to have the healthy freshmenu :),3.5
For IOS Users. Last upgrade to this app was poor. I lost all my delivery data plus it starts location services all the time while I try to order while travelling. This keeps on refreshing the app and do not allow me to order. I have never ordered after such problem. I was frequent user atleast used it twice a week. This recent upgrade which is pushed is worst as it says its not compatible and is stuck in my update history even after deleting the app. Should have done this much before and removed this app.,1.0
This is my first time ordering from them. They have an awesome menu to choose from. I ordered stuffed pesto chicken.,4.0
Freshmenu is a good home delivery option in the city with wide variety in the main course and starters. The breakfast menu could be improved with more variety. The salads are good and filling.the veggies are really fresh. Dressing is packed separately which is good. Pricing is reasonable given the quantity,3.5
Very simple to order on the website. Delivery was on time. Got the kung pao chicken and French chicken. Kung pao was decent but French chicken was below average.,3.5
"I frequently order from this outlet of Freshmenu and here are my few observations. Their kitchen is near to my place hence the delivery is fast enough. As they market stating new menu everyday, it's not the case with breakfast and dessert items. The main-course and sides are freshly prepared yet the cuisine is always limited to Oriental, Continental, Mediterranean, Mexican and occasionally Caribbean. I would strongly suggest to avoid salads with raw leafy items as in a matter of hurry they aren't cleansed properly at all. This leads to a substantial amount of sand particles in the food which is extremely harmful for your teeth, stomach and intestines.",2.5
The whole concept of food delivery and the variety of menu is amazing ..... The menu changes daily which is good ....

"Well, we have ordered thrice from fresh menu. Only the first experience was good, other two got worsened. Second time the delivery was way too late, took approx 1.75 hours and the food was not hot, just luckwarm plus the quantity was reduced. And the third time, the food taste was really worsened, delivery was late, took one hour and importantly the quantity was really very less. Absolutely disappointing. We are not ordering again.",2.0
"Always a good experience ordering with Freshmenu. Their app is very user friendly and their delivery is prompt almost all the time. My mornings start with checking out their menu and then go about other chores :D Having ordered quite a number of times from BTM Layout, must say their main courses are really good. Not a great experience with their salads. They can definitely improve there. Their desserts are good too. Here is to hoping they add much more delicious dishes to their menu .",3.5

Awesome stuff till sometime ago. You guys need to start managing your demand and supply. The last few experiences have not been so great and hence the 4 rating . my colleagues have also felt the same . we feel that the food is stale sometimes. However I did receive a free box of muffins today on account of rakshabandhan and that's an awesome gesture. Please try to get back to your original days and you will surely get 5 ratings. Thanks ...,4.0

Not only they deliver quality food, they also give us plenty of option I have been ordering for last 5 months 99% of the time they have provided owasome food. Only thing they need to improve a little is the delivery time, though most of the time they deliver in 30mins or so. Keep up the good work, also kindly look into beverage option.",4.5

They are catering a huge crowd throughout Bangalore with 15 + satellite kitchen. Huge type of innovations and modifications happens with their menu. They hosted me for their kitchen visit in that they briefed us with their market entry, product segment and all of the tiny information‚Äôs as well.",4.0
"The variety menu has reduced considerably. Main is typically limited to only pan asian items. Packaging and delivery is good. But taste is mediocre. Desert is much better compared to maincourse. I never tried the salad , soup or burgers. Cant say about them. Food presentation is also nice.",2.5
Prompt service. Delivered in time. I ordered a chicken burger which was quite tasty. However their Thai red curry was utterly disgusting. Wouldn't pay even a rupee for it and it was priced at ‚Çπ250. All I want to say about that dish was that it did not contain even an ounce of coconut and any decent place that serves Thai would know the extent of that travesty. Would never order Thai from them ever again. Pathetic.,2.5

"Happy that there is an option and get food quickly within 10 mts after online order. Yes, their delivery Center is very close to my office and in case of likely death by hunger, this is the best place to order and eat food quickly. Food taste is ok and freshness also average especially during non meal time hours but it is an good option where food is packed neatly and the menu changes everyday. Just one complaint, they do not send the food in a bag and it's embarrassing to carry containers of food openly in office. Also it's not always hot. Freshmenu is my backup option whenever I missed mealtime and want to eat ASAP.",3.5

"We at theheebee.com feel that : -- One of the best things to happen for Electronic City Foodies is that FreshMenu has started delivery in Electronic City.One day we were late in office and thought to give it a try. We ordered from the website and yo man, at the end we realized we did a very intelligent thing.They are way better than many others who deliver western cuisine in this area. One thing which was different compared to others is that by looks and quantity, the food was just how it was shown on their site. Man, who does this? Most of the times we see the comments ""* images seen may be different than the actual product"", but here it was no cheating.Coming to the ordering and delivery experience - it was very delightful. No fuss on ordering from website and food was delivered within the ETA. Loved it.Packing was very hygienic, professional and up-market.Taste, quality and quantity : Creamy Basil Chicken with rice was beyond expectation. Lovely flavors, freshly cooked. Tender and soft meat. It was served with salsa kind of sauce and some westernized pickle. Everything was amazing. Paneer Shawarma Wrap has nice taste and flavors. Paneer was well spiced, greens were in good amount and wrap base was soft. Over-all it was a very satisfying experience. It is soon becoming a repeat affair for us when we want to order food at office. Good job to the management, chef and the team.One improvement suggestion : The food when delivered to us had become cold. It will reach another stage if they can arrange ways such that food reaches us hot. Though this is not a show stopper, it will be a good improvement.",4.0
I ordered once as one of my neighbour recommended this app . As the name goes food is fresh. I had some doubts about the quantity but was pleasantly surprised as it was more than enough. One of the few sites offering good quality fish dishes. Hope they add seafood in the menu as not many offer it . one let down is there is a world of difference between the image of the dish shown in the app and the actual dish delivered. This is misleading and you can't trust this vendor.,3.5
"At the outset the items seem pricey, 200 for a veg mains, but once you have the food all your thoughts of price just vanish. The food is fabulous and made perfectly. All high quality and fresh ingredients used, u can actually feel it when you have it. They are doing great with their international cuisines with affordable Indian prices. Finally something different from the run of the mill food ordering stuff. Keep up the quality!!!!",4.5
I only tried this once. The ordering was pretty easy though the app did not work and got stuck at trying to verify my mobile number. I had to then go online and order from my PC.,3.5
The best part of fresh menu is food is sent across in minutes.. I mean in this traffic when the food reaches you in minutes its amazing.. The food too is fresh n the spice level is adjusted according to ones preference.,4.5

Finally FreshMenu started its service in Ecity.,3.5
"What struck me at first place when i visited freshmenu.com was the international cuisine. A good variety to try at modest price.

"It was a long wait for the service to be available in EC, now that it is i gave it a shot a couple of times. The amazing part is the international cuisine available at modest prices. Irrespective of what you order the striking facet would be the super fresh veggies. The service is prompt, delivery takes 30 to 40 minutes and as the menu changes everyday the variety is great.",3.5

After checking out their menu on initial launch I was eagerly awaiting Fresh Menu to start delivering in Electronic City. I must say the food tastes better than it looks and to be honest it looks fantastic! Low oil, medium spiced, reasonably priced, interesting dishes delivered in a flash. Love their fish items especially. Desserts are delightful as well. Courteous delivery staff and brilliant customer team too. Just hope they keep up the quality.",5.0
"I tried out freshmenu for lunch a few days back and the experience was amazing. They delivered really quickly, within 45 mins. I really loved the items on their menu and was spoilt for choice. I got the Mustard grilled fish with Basil rice and the Moroccan Croissant sandwich. The fish combo with rice was really good, tasty fish and nice gravy too. The packaging was brilliantly done too. Will surely be frequenting it in the future. The prices are little more than reasonable but I guess it's alright, considering there are no other similar food options in the area.",4.5
First time I ordered from freshmenu.com and my experience was worth taking a chance. I just got amazed by the delivery time.. They r dot on time. Good was quite delicious and got them streaming hot..

"Was a little apprehensive about ordering after reading all the horror stories in the Play Store reviews but fortunately none of those happened with me. Ordered a grilled fish meal and got delivery within half an hour. Very nice packaging and presentation. Taste, flavour and quantity were as promised.

Must try the burgers and sandwiches, also u will love their packing. The food comes as it is.",4.0
Ordered the noodles with thai chicken satay..the flavours were abit strong for me.. could feel the galangal. Also ordered thai sliders veg and Moroccan chicken sandwiches. Both were good. Delivery was quick and excellent. Overall the meal is value for money !,3.5
"By far the only way to eat hearty world cuisine at a reasonable price. I order lunch from freshmenu often and I am yet to taste a bad dish. My favourites are the crepes, all kinds of pasta, the quesadillas, sliders and their Moroccan couscous dish. In fact, I am ordering a wrap from them right now. I wish they'd have two salad options instead of one for vegetarians as I really don't care for some of them.",4.0
If I could have given a rating below this I most definitely would. I ordered lunch from here today and regretted it oh so much. I would want to tell everyone who's planing to try this freshmenu outlet DONT ORDER FROM HERE. After ordering the food online an hour later I get a msg saying that it will be delivered in 30 minutes. In an age where almost all places deliver with in 45 minutes max to max this is completely unacceptable. And to think after it arrived at least the food would be edible. But no. It was one of the worst things I have ever eaten. I had ordered a braised diced chicken with fried rice. Most of it was tasteless and what had taste just tasted very bad. They had some dirty salad on top of the rice with cabbage n so much of oil in it that seeped into the entire rice. N they just put random crap to fill in the compartments of the box. Which had another salad which was totally inedible with so much vinegar in it. Anyone who ate it would surely get a stomach upset. The meal costed 250 bucks and wasn't worth a single penny. If I wanted to order cheap Chinese food I would have ordered from a cheap Chinese restaurant and would have still got better stuff than this. I called customer service to report the delay and they said that that particular outlet had technical problems bla bla bla. If you have technical problems it is your problem not mine. Shut the place for the day and don't do bad business and cause so much of inconvenience to customers. A single day of bad service can cost you way more than if you shut down and get yourself sorted. Food is not like some electronic equipment ordered online that u can afford to deliver late. If you can't deliver on time call and inform and I would have ordered from somewhere else. WORST experience with food EVER! Oh and also I kept asking the customer service guy on the phone which outlet is this and instead of answering my question he kept giving explanations with niceties. Save it and get to the point. This outlet is just below the accepted standards of freshmenu or restaurants in general.,1.0
"As someone who cringes at the thought of having to order roti curry for lunch if I can't carry lunch from home, Fresh Menu was a godsend! Fresh, continental food in eatable portions and totally easy on the pocket! The food is tasty, light, and suitable for office. It isn't greasy and won't put you to sleep. And I really love the price tag. The only thing is that you might find it a bit bland if you're fond of really spicy food, but I don't feel that's such a big problem. Seriously, thank you Fresh Menu.",4.5

"Fresh Menu has always been a life savour when you are damn hungry at work or when one is not in a mood to cook! Serving some scrumptious cuisines at very good rates is commendable. I'm a big fan of there sliders and would say can have it almost everyday! So, recently I was asked to try out there Mongolian rice, not to forget there service is super quick and would deliver the food before time. The food arrived at the correct time when I was starving for lunch. Tasted there Mongolian Rice for the very first time! Quantity was very apt for a single person. Rice was properly cooked and the spices added brilliance to it! It was nice but I won't say something out of this world! The mushrooms with rice was going really well as compared to the other vegetables! But surely a good thing to try out! I'm highly impressed by the service and the quality of food they deliver! Inspite of being so many competitors now a days fresh menu makes it's way by the quality and variety of food they deliver! I would highly recommend it and make sure you try out there different cuisines from the menu!  #HappyHogging",4.0

Today for the first time I have ordered food from Fresh Menu with Main course. I got a call after 10 mins telling that we don't serve main course after 3 so me have to made changes in the food and have to order sides as I have already paid the amount. The food arrived on time but quality of food was not at all good and paneer wraps(sides) were cold like they have take out of refrigerator and packed to serve customers. This is my first and the last time with Fresh Menu and will not like to try ever again as my first experience was so bad that I have no courage to try it again.,1.0
I am a regular customer of Fresh Menu but that might change now. They were very good with the food but are now slipping. I just now ordered two servings of their very good tomato basil soup. My soup arrived without any basil and without any croutons. Last time they had managed to screw another of their good ones - the veg sliders. Fresh Menu is turning into just another of those businesses that start awesome and just dwindle on their way. When I ordered the veg sliders for the first couple of times I got delicious sliders with some wedges. Then the wedges disappeared but that is okay because I still had the awesome sliders. And last time they served me terrible dry sliders with NO sauce! And in one of them was a super oily burnt patty.... Time to say bye bye Fresh Menu...,1.5

"I've been ordering from freshmenu quite a bit so I'm now well placed to review. My experience with them has been nothing short of fantastic. The food is great. Delivery time in lightening. Have even ordered just a soup for 70/- to check their claim of no min order and it came with a smile. Some of the things I liked - the soups, salads, the noodles with meat balls, desserts. Actually I've loved everything I've ordered. Wish you well.",5.0
I have been tracking Fresh Menu for last 2 months and have ordered more than 3 times. Hence decided to give my review absolutely convinced. All the 3 experiences resulted in this order of priority 1. Timely delivery Infact super fast under 30 mins even when ordered from 2 different locations. 2. Excellent quality of food healthy and fresh true to its name!! 3. Portion is sufficient for a health conscious individual. The main dishes like chimacinga took me back to my days in Texas and was perfect healthy Tex mex food. Wraps were good and the broccoli corn soup was just right on all accounts. Fresh menu will be part of our regular diet in my family!!,5.0

"Order was delivered on time freshmenu hennur.  Orderered cheesy potato ball,  chicken drumstick in kadhai gravy and teriyaki grilled fish with noodle. Chicken drumstick and potatoes was  bland,  rice and noodle were ok,  fish had a burnt taste. The curries had below average taste. Cheese balls were some what under cooked. For me its was definitely first and last time order.  Freshmenu didnot meet my expectations...",1.0

"I mostly order the salads on a regular basis, and as an aside decided to order something light to go with my lunch order of salad as I was feeling ravenous the other day. And so I went for the cottage cheese croissant to go with my salad order. I was pretty blown away to see just how sizeable the supposedly 'light' side order was - two large generous chunks of succulent cottage cheese with yummy pickles and melt in your mouth croissant along with a slice of cheese. Truly amazed by how much value for money these chef made meals are. Thanks FreshMenu for making life easier. ¬†I'm a fan!",5.0

It has been one of the most amazing food options when at office. Finding someone serve you fresh salad at a reasonable price is a delight. Without a doing the their salads and deserts win hands down! Must try if you are looking at healthy foods to Indulge into!,4.5
I had ordered from here while I was visiting at a friends place. The food from fresh menu is delicious and even more so for the minimal price it comes at. They have a good choice of veg and non-veg dishes. I love the spaghetti bolognese and meat balls and grilled chicken and herb rice. They also have a good selection of starters and deliver quite fast too.,4.0
"Big Up to the Freshmenu team at Kammanhalli for getting high quality food delivered to Manyata on time! For an office party, we ordered a ton of food that was delivered to us in flat 45 mins. Our order consisted of Mexican grilled Chicken wraps, Sicilian style Veg Pasta, Oriental spice Potato steak with rice, South West Ranch sliders, Rustic Greek Grouper with rice, Black Pepper Honey Chicken with rice and Hawaiian melting poppers. Best out of all were the grouper rice, veg pasta, pepper honey chicken steak and grilled wraps. The chicken steak was excellent, perfectly cooked and succulent! Each of the items is filling and a meal in itself, so order wisely! Half point is taken off for the beetroot salad though, which was a bit stale!",4.5
"Ask ur Delivery boys to ride carefully without taking lives of citizens on the streets . If something had happened to me today by chance , I would've sued ur delivery boy which would've brought ur outlet under bad light .

Almost everything I've tried from here has been quite good. Flavorful and they have quite a choice every day. Their delivery is worth a mention too - always been under 30 mins after ordering.,4.5
"While I love fresh menu and order from here almost thrice a week I had a terrible experience today with their middle eastern grilled chicken. I love their portions normally but today it was 2 pieces of starved chicken dry and with little flavor . The chicken was spoiled so I had to ask them to replace it which they did. The second box was no better but slightly more fresh. For the price this dish is a rip off , 5 pieces of veggies with bread and 2 dry pieces of chicken not worth it.. its nothing like what u have on the display",1.5
So it was this Thursday an early weekend that me n my sis were getting bored at her place in kalyan Nagar..An idea jus popped up and we thought of ordering from Freshmenu.

"Only a name or pictures depicts fresh out of Fresh Menu. I heard their name and thought of trying them. Delivered right in time, portions were also nice, sight of the food was also edible, combination of veggies were also good but disaster was the taste. Everything seem old like a frozen stuff. We order black pepper homey vhicken and mahi mahi with herb rice. Chicken dish was still ok. But fish was pathetic, hard like some other meet. Herb rice were not properly cooked only. It was Last time for me to expect fresh out of fresh menu.",1.0

"I had heard so much about fresh menu that I decided to try it finally. Since I was alone I decided to go for mexican menu. It looked really yum in the pics. So went ahead and ordered a mexican menu for Rs 400. First issue, the delivery boy didnt have even 100 bucks on him. so i ended up giving an unwilling tip of 50. Next the food itself, packaged very nicely. opened it and found small serving of rajma disguised as mexican beans, romato chutney ( the bad version) as salsa. And I have no clue what was the white stuff in it. maida chapati folded as quesadilla. maida chips given a new name nachos. seriously guys? you think we dont know what is mexican food?",1.5

They have been expanding in terms of areas they deliver to but it seems to have affected quality a bit. The most recent order of kung pao chicken rice bowl was case in point- the ingredients was of good quality and the chicken was well cooked but the dish as a whole left a lot to be desired.  The rice was bland and felt not part of the dish.  A colleagues fish was a bit undercooked too. Hope this does not end up being the norm as they have a lot of potential.,3.5

"I had placed an order via Swiggy the last time for this place and liked the food. There was an issue with the Swiggy app this time around and I placed an order on Zomato which got rejected by the restaurant. I then placed an order directly on Fresh Menu's website (imagine the persistence). Order was placed at 1 pm. After 45 min I called the outlet and they said the rider has left and will be there in 10 min. At 2:10 I got out of a meeting and realized my lunch was still not there. I called the outlet again, this time they told me after putting me on hold for minutes that there was a problem with the kitchen and the food is now getting out. I was so pissed I hung up. I told my staff that if the order comes any min post 220 don't accept it. I was starving and would have still accepted the order until I walked out hungry for a meeting at 2:45. I got a call from my office at 2:55 that the order has come from Fresh Menu. I regret I wasn't polite telling my colleague what to answer but a starving stomach can always have reasons.",1.0

I really like the main course here. Have ordered around 5 times by now and the food has always been good. However I did not like the salad I once ordered. I dont think it was worth 150 bucks. Not that good. Paneer wraps and Croissant did not have good paneer. It was a bit hard. Paneer should always be soft. Main course has always been good though. I will definitely order more in future. Yet to try burgers. Sometimes I just like looking at their site :p. So beautiful looking food. Hope these guys will keep up the quality and taste of their food. And ya packing is always good. Guys please repeat the middle eastern chicken and chicken steak with herb rice and mushroom sauce. I loved it.,4.0
"perfectly cooked food, i have only had non veg here and i must say they use very little oil. However the food does is a bit bland the sauce they give does help to give more flavor to their chicken dishes but amount of sauce they give is not enough. ¬†The packaging is amazing i don't need the wash any plate i just use the stuff they give. I don't know about their other outlets but i can say for certain that every time i order it comes within 25 min.finally the price. It is cheap enough to almost eat here everyday and healthy enough to. But the menu does not change completely everyday you will find some dishes that are repeated but they are good dishes.",3.5
I really liked the idea of having different menu each day serving different cuisines. Before ordering I was not sure that they have delivery option to my area or not but to my surprise they did.,3.5

"Placed my first order on freshmenu . Its been a while since I've been drooling over the pictures on their app and had to fight myself against my monetary constraints (I live off dads money) . So they take an hour to deliver , 15 minutes more than what they promise . I wished they had it packed in a paper bag . it would have helped me since its quite a walk from the gate to the hostel (Christ University) . Nothing like what it looks on plate but that would have been unreasonable to expect . They deliver it in a nice package with a fork and a spoon . There wasn't any spillage , so job well done with packing. ¬†The grilled chicken was tender and came off easily . They had sauteed? veggies by the side , that included carrots , baby corn , brocolli? - and tangy pickled? beetroot . It was all well flavoured nothing too overly spiced except for the tangy beetroots -not necessarily a complaint . ¬†I liked what was served if not loved although found the portions too less but I'm a hungry , 'need to be well fed' student who has a budget to stick to . So , Am I going to do this often ? not likely. But a good trial indeed . I'll give their manakeesh a try someday and also their desserts and the croissant sandwich which looks amazingly appetizing",3.0
The quality has declined in the past month.  The mushroom dish had no mushrooms and the chicken was undercooked. The food is consistently failing to meet the quality standards freshmenu had earlier. Not great,2.5

"I usually order for the salads from this place. Sometimes  it's  really good. I.e adequate amounts of chicken, peppers etc, but off late I ve observed they fill up the close to half the  serving with lettuce & cucumber, and skimp on the capsicum and chicken. Please note freshmenu that the 'calorie conscious' people your salads target, usually have a good knowledge of nutrition as well. The best salad IMO is the three bean quinoa salad- no cucumber, just the goodness of legumes and a decent portion of chicken.  Freshmenu is such a brilliant concept, the food is not overly processed and is frequently tasty and healthy at the same time (Maggi take note). You guys would do well to maintain some sort of quality control.",3.0

Last time I ordered for a thai curry with basil rice and the thai curry had a lot more of coconut milk than the regular thai curries. I like your service but each time i order one of the dish is screwed up. Cannot believe that i can taste two types of thai curry from FreshMenu when ordered from two different places. :( You guys prepare very good food and one of your item like side portion of vegetables will ruin the happiness while having lunch :( this is Disappointing..",3.0

"If you love pasta and burgers or any other continental food its difficult to, not be tempted by the photos of the freshmenu's daily changing menu. Like their name sake they are authentic tasting and fresh. The portions are fulfilling for individuals.¬†So, I finally ordered on the payday (stuff is the expensive ). Loved it. Detailed list n review soon.",4.0
Tried the Italian platter.,3.5
"After a trip to their Koramangala kitchen, which also is their central baking hub, I am even more impressed with Freshmenu. They are trying newer and more interesting options for their menu. There were some amazing dishes and desserts that we tried in their very first 'Taste Chronicles'. My favorites from the afternoon were their take on manakeesh with different dips like Hummus, Sun dried Tomato paste and more.",4.0
"Finally, something innovative and interesting at the same time. Off the 'mainstream' and food that goes easy on your tastebuds (PS: fresh menu may consider avoiding excessive use of bell peppers and other tasteless veggies) What gives this place the ability to make you want to go back every single day and check up what's 'cooking' is the highly responsive mobile app and a dedicated bunch of hospitality SME's! Though the quality of the packaging materials have gone down a little, there is no compromise on the quality of food served (so far) . Highly recommended!",4.0
"In addition to being impressed with the Kalyannagar outlet, I was equally enthralled with the Koramangala Kitchen. We are regulars with ordering from the hennur outlet and it hasn‚Äôt disappointed us so far.",4.5
Daughter in law recommended to sis in law who tried out and told us!Had Veg Sicilian Pesto sliders and Thai Veg Yellow curry with Basil rice.The food came warm from Jakkasandra to Tavarekere Main Rd in 45mts.The packs were foodgrade and pleasing.The sliders ie mini burgers were wholesome and fresh.The Thai curry delicately flavoured with fresh ingredients eg. the yellow peppers were crunchy! The portions left a little bit over after the two of us had filled ourselves. The best part is one still felt up to getting back to work afterwards..,4.5

"I have been ordering food from freshmenu.com for over a month and I must say the concept of a daily changing menu is quite different and exciting! I love their mega burgers, fish fingers and the chocolate chip cookies, they are like my favs !! The food is very tasty and well cooked and the delivery is most of the times right one time!!",4.0

"Have tried their noodle bowl, Thai salad and vegetable dumplings. Good taste and satisfying portions. The best part is that the food is really fresh, and there's a change in menu everyday. A negative is that the delivery time is a little high. Still a ood option for ordering in healthy food.",4.0
"Try the laksa and tom yum soup. They are absolutely delicious! The ' love in a jar' is waiting on the table and smells wonderful. A must order for valentines day. Tasted it now and it is great. Very veg though. I would have preferred an eggful, buttery and cowcreamy version. This apart from wonderful textures has an artificial whiff about it due to the weird white mousse. I germanized it black forest style with cherry liquer. If you want to follow in step your best shot is coantreau, 3 tea spoons down the insides of the glass, turn and give min. 30 to soak through. E n j o y~ and don't forget to share.",4.5
"There seems to be mixed reviews about this place.....well, my experience was quite good ! Bored of regular food for lunchtime at office, decided to order from here. My order of Asian Bbq Fish with Noodles was delivered faster than I expected actually. It was packaged neatly and looked very inviting. The fish seemed fresh and tasted pretty nice. The fried babycorn they served on the side was crunchy and delicious and the overall portion was perfect for my appetite. Overall, nothing that would blow you away, but certainly something that you can ¬†rely on for a great weekday lunch. :)",4.0
The webpage is well made with stunning photographs of dishes which are chef made. They have a daily rotating menu. ¬†Ordered Chermoula Cottage Cheese Steak with Fusilli Pasta (veg). Must say the food tasted good. Also the service was prompt and I enjoyed the food.,3.5
I have given this place a rating of 4 because I have never got a restaurant quality food delivered like this before.  The packing was excellent and the food was delivered within an hour still warm. The food was tasty but not out of the world though. The food seemed healthy too. Would definitely order again when I feel like having something at home.,4.0
The concept is brilliant however the execution is not.  Fancy packaging and a fashionable app can only cover up so much for substandard food.,2.0
"I placed an order today at 745 pm with their Koramangala branch. It's 920pm and the order has not shown up! The customer care had my name and order mixed up! The focus of the call seemed to be to collect my email ID and not the fact that I was waiting on the delivery that was hugely delayed! The guy on the phone eventually made a lame ass excuse that it was raining (maybe a light drizzle, since I'm a stone's throw away from them), and I eventually told them to spare the trouble! Their website's cart functionality was broken and I couldn't place my order on their site either to start with. These guys are a total BS setup.",1.0

"This is definitely a great initiative. Fresh menu provides different items everyday. Their menu always looks great and they have prompt delivery services. However, the taste of the food is inconsistent in my opinion. One day if they send chicken which is overcooked, the next day their chicken would be almost perfectly cooked. Same with salads or pasta. Somedays they are bland, somedays not so bland. Their dishes look fancy though and hygienic. With the consistency factor being consistent the food would become really popular.",2.5

To sum it up they arent less than an indian politician.. Big promises small implementation.. I had to call them 4times to get my order and guess what? Its midnight n still not here.. The order was placed well before their closing time.. They dint even bother till i called.. Im hungry and without any other restos open at this hr.. Stop advertising like pros when u can deliver on the promises make.. God know how long i wud need to chase them for my refund for a shitty service.. A first time customer lost forever,1.0

The best part is the way they package and deliver the food. Makes it very convenient to eat at any place. My order did have a littly satly. Better to keep it less salty and provide packets of salt instead. After all this caters to health conscious food eaters. The portion is good but there is room to make the food more authentic in taste.,3.5

I heard mixed reviews of FreshMenu until one day I tried it by myself.,3.5
"Good variety in their menu.... I loved their starters and u must try the Musallam curry(hope i got name right) it was awesome.  Am rating this place 3.5 cos of the change in the food quality compared to the initial months of their launch, which was very good and cos of their desserts which I wouldnt recomend you to take, cos it seems to never match their description (i had ordered their tiramisu jar and found no trace of coffee flavor, it was just layers of whipped cream and chocolate sponge) and I am a dessert person!! But they make up for it in  their mains, starters and yummy salads!!! You can order from here once in a while when you want to try something different and I do hope they keep up their quality else its not worth the money your paying for something different.",3.5

"I have ordered a couple of times from Fresh Menu and my experience has always been good. The delivery time is a little long - 45min to 1 hour. However, it's fresh and well packed. Menu each day is different and they have a variety of dishes that you wouldn't normally get if you walked into any of local restaurants.",4.5
Ordered grilled fish with Mexican green rice for lunch. Delivery time was not very fast but the food was warm when it was delivered to me. Freshness and taste were good as I relished the 1st morsel. Fish was nicely done with mild spices and good flavour. Rice was pretty average and I would have liked a bit more quantity of rice. Actually the overall quantity can be improved if you are charging 250bucks. All in all it was a good 1st experience and I would like to try something desi now. I would give them an extra 0.5 rating for their delivery and hygienic packing.,4.0
"I have just come back to Bangalore and ordering for last 15 days. I have ordered salads, desserts and almost everything :) :). I would say this is one of the best home delivered continental food.

"I have ordered from freshmenu couple of times so here is my review . The food was delivered very late (90+ minutes) but the quality of the food, packaging and taste was sublime. Well presented and healthy loved the pasta and the chicken. The chicken was not over done and was succulent and the pasta was not soaked in tomato sauce. Apart from the delay, I have had a wonderful experience. Keep up the good work",4.5

Last weekend I was really disappointed when we ordered for dinner from freshmenu. First of all the delivery took 1hr 20min though we stay very close to marathalli. Secondly the quality of the food as per the price is very poor. The food was not at all fresh as the raw veggies were smelling and were not edible. They are really overpriced as in Bangalore we have many more continental restaurant which serve better food at a cheaper price. They should improve the quality.,2.0
"The days when you crave for continental food but either you are too lazy or cannot step out of your home or desk.. Freshmenu is the solution.Amazing food.Value for money. Timely delivery.

Was not a big deal as most of my company hails from the Hospitality Industry. The brunch turned out to be a Smash-hit, mainly because of the Delectable food!. ¬†That day, (a little drunk) friend of mine asked - ""Why can't we start a Weekend home delivery option? 4 of us would be enough!"" We thought - and obviously, laughed! After all, who has time? Well, someone else, in IIM Ahmedabad sure did have time to think, visualize, plan & implement!",4.0
I've ordered twice from this place but the food did not appease my pallets at all! The keema had no taste and quantity was very little.

Good aesthetics of packing with properly packed tissues and plastic cutlery. Arabian sliders were just OK, nothing great but not bad. Red Thai curry and basil rise was absolutely fantastic. It can be compared to any fancy Thai/Oriental restaurant. Perfect red curry taste with lemongrass, bamboo shoots and red chilies ..yummmmmm. Quantity of red curry ¬†was definitely a let down, it was not enough for the small quantity of rice provided.

"Hi , I ordered 2 greek salads , order number  ‚Ä™#‚ÄéFM12710322‚Ä¨, I primarily order from freshmenu assuming I get good food and fresh, sometimes the quality is good but some time¬†it is not, the consistency is missing and looks like is dependent on the mood of the cook/chef ( if there is one), today I was very disappointed with what was promised and what I got, the salad hardly had any olives and chiken in it, I have attached the pictures of what I received vs what was promised",2.5
"I have been quite a regular customer for the past one month, ordering almost 3 times a week! In my first order, I was served raw chicken. That, however, was remedied promptly and they promised not to repeat it. I was glad too, coz they actually didn't repeat it. I was never served raw chicken again. The quality of food was spot on for the first two weeks. And then it started! Like when it happens when you start relying on something too much- you see the betrayal. The food no longer resembled the pictures, paninis were stale, vegetarian salads were soggy, chicken with main course cold and dry, portions of chicken in salads reduced.",2.5
"I had ordered a Greek salad and a sliced Chicken and pepper dish. I was really impressed by the way the food was packed. Coming to the food, the veggies used in the salad seemed fresh and juicy. The chicken and pepper dish tasted good but the chicken pieces were slightly hard. No complain apart from that. Over all, it was a good experience :)",3.5
"The fact that they have a daily changing menu lures me into ordering food from Fresh Menu. The last time, the ""Grilled Chicken Caffreal "" that I ordered was absolutely delicious. However, I was really disappointed by the Cottage cheese harissa with rice today. The sauce was a bit sour for my taste, and the big veggie chunks were not cooked well. They should have added cottage cheese more generously. I was left with lots of rice but not vegetable at the end. The Thai curry with fried rice was replete with flavor, but then again the quantity of the curry could have been more. I wish to try more from their menu, hence, I would advise them to work more on their vegetarian dishes!",3.5

I used to be a regular customer of freshmenu but the quality and the quality of service has really gone down. I loved the main courses and the salads that you had to offer but now I don't even bother with the main course. I kept up with salads but recently there are more misses than hits. The salads are no longer what is advertised on the website and in no way it's a 'full meal' now.,2.5

Hope they ¬†take my review seriously and work on it.",3.5
Great service and Food quality. I am especially delighted by their Salad service as I was unable to get salads easily in Bangalore. This allows be to consume my daily quota of veggies.,4.5
"Have been trying for the last one week after hearing around about this-- delivery is a big issue- never on time, delivery guys don't understand directions, the 45min commitment is just namesake. And by the time the food reaches its luke warm -- makes little sense to order, when I have to play with this in the kitchen again to make it edible. Guess there is a delivery crunch in terms of manpower so fix that pls. Also Bangalore rains shouldn't be an excuse to delay delivery since the weather here is not something new and is going to continue like this for another 6 months -- with a 3hr lead time not sure how many orders you'll get this way.",2.0
"I consider my self to be a regular customer of Freshmenu and have seen a consistent decline in the quality and taste of food. My last three orders were pretty sub standard but today was just the tipping point. I had ordered Veg Moroccan Sliders- the order came with three buns with one having no patty or stuffing but just some cheese and tomato. Struggling to figure how you can send something like that to your customers. The side of potato wedges was the shittiest food I have ever put in my mouth. It was oily as hell, raw and unseasoned (no salt!!) and I have had the wedges in the past from you and it was much better than what I ate today. The other thing I want to highlight is I am all for fast delivery and prompt service but I place my order at 1:03 pm and the order is marked as out for delivery at 1:04 pm then its a little too fast for comfort and liking. This is probably the last time I have ordered from Freshmenu.com unless they really pull their socks up and improve the food being served!!",2.5
Excellent gourmet food. But service is sporadic. Once they delivered within 20min and a repeat of 1item which was excellent was delivered nearly at 4pm which is 2hours after order.,4.0

"I loved the concept once I heard about fresh menu from a friend. I tried it immediately by trying a non-veg salad. The app, delivery, taste and packing were all great. The portions were pretty good too. Since then I have ordered multiple chicken salads, Thai style fish cakes and couple of mousse for dessert. All the items were delivered in time. Helps that the distribution centre is close to my home. Couple of times they forgot the spoon and fork. Otherwise everything has been impeccable. I would recommend a subscription service at a cheaper rate to make it more affordable. They could also add soups to their menu.",4.0

"Freshmenu promises and delivers. Their hard work shows -in their website, their food, customer service. The concept is really like a breath of fresh air. ¬†New menus to choose from everyday. A lot of innovation and creativity goes into setting up the menu and it shows. I'm glad they stick to Continental and Asian -Bengaluru certainly doesn't need any more Biriyani and Pizza joints.",4.5
"My experience with freshmenu.com is excellent. They delivered within 45 mins, which is pretty prompt. I had ordered Thai Noodles and Chicken Meatballs from them. The noodles was really ¬†good, and the way they had packed was thoughtful and good. Really appreciate the food quality and the service. Highly recommendable.",4.5
"My experience with them was real good! One Sunday night I decided that I was too lazy and had to order. After I gave my order, they told me that since it was raining heavily the order delivery might get delayed to about 1+ hours, but they did deliver in like, 30-45 mins.",4.0
"We ordered food from Fresh Menu Marathalli , the food quality was good but delivery was bad. Took lot of time and even the people who delivers have less idea about the place. So better to provide them with navigation tools so that its easier for them to reach. Quantity of food is also less as compared to price.",3.0
So nice to have a online delivery hotel in marathahalli. One evening we planned to have italian and choose this. The tastes good and delivery time is so punctual. Food is well wrapped and looking nice. The menu was very limited. Price is moderate and they can actually increase there menu. Good initiative ....,3.0
Kudos to the team...ordering was hassle free  and the food was delivered within 15minutes. The delivery person didn't bother me with repeated phone calls asking for address or route:) which I appreciate much,4.5
Liked the concept of new menu every day. Ordered parsley crusted fish with pasta in tomato basil sauce. Delivery person knew the area so didn't ask for directions. Wish he had change with him. Difficult to give exact amount. Food ¬†delivered within 1 hr & was still warm. Packaging was good. Basa fish was fresh & tasted great. I am not very fond of tomato based sauce but the pasta was very flavourful.the side of vegetables was good but ¬†can be steamed a little more. Extra sauce was also provided. Over all a nice experience if you want to order continental food at home. Pricing is ok but surely not for daily basis.,4.0

"Ordered from freshmenu for the first time and I was impressed with the packaging and the dish chilli parsley fish was yum, though on the spicier side, need to tone down a bit on the chillies. Pricewise, I would say its quite affordable as compared to the fancy prices in the restaurants, quality wise and quantity wise too it gained an upperhand as compared to the restaurants. Quite happy on the whole.",4.5
"The food is good. Cooked to perfection if I must say. Neat packing, on time delivery and no extra charges. The quantity of the food is decent and sufficient for one person.

Previously the food was really good. The kast two meals ordered were really average. Not happy. Delivery issues and also veg mains and snacks were not at all good,3.5
"I ordered a couple of times from their app. First of all I would like to say their service is pathetic. No tracking, you never know your food is comming or not. The food is just average. Nothing special as such. At this pricing there are much better places nearby.",3.0
"I have absolutely loved everything I have ordered from this place. I was initially a little skeptical about the sea food, but it was fresh and delicious. There are loads of vegetables in everything. So even though it's tasty...  You end up feeling light and not so guilty.  Packaging is excellent. And they deliver within thirty minutes. Perfect for those sudden hunger pangs. My favourites have been Fish in lemon coriander sauce, the falafel, the black forest pudding, the banana cake,  and lemon tart (lots of guilt). Their sandwiches are also good. Quantity is great too. Totally worth the price.",4.5
I ordered from Freshmenu. Com today after looking through so many positive reviews!,4.0

"I had ordered veg salad with pasta and one double flower with plum sauce(description of that is broccoli and cauliflower with corn flour and plum sauce). So what I got in the packet is in the name of salad few pieces of pasta, lot of tomatoes and 2 piece raw broccoli with out salt and any other ingredient. This pasta was completely different than what they mention in their menu which was very disappointing. In the name of double flower there were only cauliflower which was fully oil or dalda fried with some corn flour which was pathetic in taste ?. I will never order from this place again.",1.5

The true appeal is their menu and it's truly unique.  Exotic dishes with global flavours and everyday, new food.  That's exactly what a foodie like me needs.  Being a veggie, I am happy with their vegetarian options and always consistent, neat packaging.",4.5
"Had heard several reviews about Freshmenu and had to try it once they actually started operating this side of town. It has been a great experience - have ended up ordering a couple of times a week. Great food, good taste and conveniently packed - all in all well worth the price.",4.5
We are happy to get what we see in your Menu. ¬†Do add soups to your Menu! ¬†Choice of breads would also be a great addition. ¬†Your Muffins are excellent!,4.5
Had a horrible experience. Ordered the food at 7 and they said it will get here in half an hour. Then after I call after an hour I get a message that the food is delivered though it is not. At 8.45 it comes. I am vegetarian and I had ordered veg food but they sent me something which on the cover says veg but the label on the box says non-veg. The manager made some lame excuses like because it was raining.... Totally insensitive. This was the Rajajinagar branch. So vegetarians beware. Eat at your own risk!,1.0
"Love it ! Since I started exploring healthy  lunch at office, I think FreshMenu is The only one option I have , everyday at I started starving just for the Fresh Menu on lunch time, I'm on strict diet for some medical issues, thanks a lot to fresh menu for keeping me healthy. I would really like to have Gluten free options often, Not only rice something different.",5.0

"I came across FreshMenu.com when they were delivering only in Sarjapura. And I've been checking their page regularly, almost on a daily basis, to see if they opened a kitchen near where I stay, Malleshwaram. They finally did about a year later if I'm not wrong, give or take 2 months. The whole ordering process is very convenient; simple and fast. They delivered 10 minutes after quoted delivery time, but overall it was a short wait. The packing was good and secured the food.",4.0

"I have ordered from Fresh Menu 4 times so far. Mostly, I found the food to be tasty and cooked with authentic ingredients. Some people may not like it if they prefer to eat Indianized version of Italian, or Chinese food. The price is reasonable and delivery is quick. Most of dishes do look healthy. The portions may feel small because food tastes good. In comparison to other online places, I found that Fresh Menu offers the best combination of price, food quality and delivery time.",4.5
"This really took me by surprise! Didn't expect it to be as good as the pictures on the app, but it was. Excellent quantity for the price too!",4.0
I've been a huge fan of vegetarian dishes which Freshmenu puts out each day. The notifications I receive everyday on the menu certainly works up my appetite!!

Though they are slightly overpriced, I don't mind as long as they promise to give me the same quality of food and service.",4.0
Fantastic!!!!,4.5
"due to the continuous raining, we decide to order food from FreshMenu. We wanted to keep it light and simple. So ordered for 1 Chicken burger and chicken salad. For my surprise, the meal was quiet full for two people. Given the fact that, it was pouring, the delivery guy did his best what he could do. To compensate what ever very little time lag, they even delighted me with a complimentary dessert. more than that, the food was still warm enough to enjoy, with nice packing.",4.5
"I've been ordering from FreshMenu at least once a day for the last two weeks. The food's really good and easy on my pocket, too: for about Rs.300, I can stuff myself and I'm no small eater. I'm not a fan of sandwiches (although the croissant I've heard is quite good) so I usually go for an item in the Mains column one from the Salads.",4.5
"I had heard so much from everyone that freshmenu is great and I should try it. So I finally gave it a shot and I'm thrilled! The menu spread is good. I was not too sure if they could pull off italian so I tried that. I ordered Rigatoni with zucchini and bell peppers and an eggless moist chocolate cake. There was some network issue with my phone so I didn't know when the delivery had arrived. The delivery person waited for a long time till he was finally able to reach me and deliver the food. I was immensely impressed by this as usually no one wants to wait in one place for this long for delivery. The packing of the food was of great quality. Along with the pasta, there was a piece of bread roll, some corn salad in mayonnaise, and some pickled vegetables. My only small complaint is of the pasta being a little too oily else it tasted amazing! It was full of flavor and it tasted great and so did the condiments with it. The cake lived upto its name for being moist! I have never had such a moist eggless cake before. I was very happy with my dinner and was too full to move after it!",4.5

So I ordered Honey mustard cottage Cheese pasta , Coriander rice with tofu and a Crossiant sandwich. All the 3 tasted brilliant but the outstanding thing is all of them had loads and loads and loads and loads of fresh vegetables. The tofu in the coriander rice tasted great! Will be ordering soon and looking forward to their desserts. The quantity is really good. Must must try. Totally recommend it. Service is super fast. 20-25 mins. Keep up the job guys!",4.0

I placed an order using the mobile app and wanted the delivery at my office in Peenya Industrial Area. I received a call from the customer care saying that they do not service this area. As always i got disappointed as non of the online delivery app service Peenya. And just after 5 mins I get a call from the delivery person for reconfirming the address and he said he is on his way for the delivery. I was extremely excited as someone is able to deliver to Peenya. The food arrived after 25 mins after placing the order. Received in an amazing packing and interestingly the packing is microwave safe. I had ordered for a Veg Combo Meal. The food was hot and tasted fantastic. Most importantly it doesn't taste like any other takeaway. It tastes as fresh as it's served like in a restaurant. The concept of fresh menu everyday would definitely make me order frequently.,4.5

A Company that tries to brand itself as premium / gourmet food has to pay some attention to its packaging, in addition to the quality of the food (which also seems to be deteriorating)... Black containers bring to mind cheap, recycled stuff.. there's a reason its black and there's a reason why food is not usually packed / served in black containers...

Both said they have broccoli, but where's it? I couldn't find it anywhere. Reiterating, it happened for the third time on ordering salads... I could only see a pile of lettuce. My request is you rename your salads as lettuce salads also. their presence in the salads are way more than the other veggies in minority.

Was in Bangalore most of last week & had made list of the places to visit even before I reached. But this time didn‚Äôt have enough time & company to step out for lunch.

"Freshmenu is a great concept. The whole idea of a new recipe everyday sounds good.  I first tried singing hunan fish and it was great. But when I ordered a grilled fish the second time,  I saw the same manchow gravy served. Also the fish basa doesn't taste well all the time. The food was delicious but I don't think I will order the fish again. Didn't seem like I am having something new. Ain't that the whole concept  ""fresh menu"" itself wants to promote. More updates after I try other recipes.",2.5
"The major plus point for them is that they have a new menu coming up daily. Also, they're convenient when it comes to delivery. A customer doesn't have to wait for long for their food delivery. So, it's a win win.",5.0

"It is hard to arrive at a rating when the service provider is flippant in their quality. They started well with decent portions and competitive pricing, but graduated to fewer portions and disgustingly over priced and dip in quality. The jamboree ordered yesterday was a disaster and contained no chicken at all but mentioned the same in the Menu.

I ended up getting Chicken Shish Taouk, Persian Pila. They didn't even inform that it was not there. Have heard a lot about food quality, i was still optimistic......turned out to be disappointing.

Despite the apologetic tone, I had to turn down the offer since we were very hungry and could not wait for another 20 mins.

"Freshmenu is quite a refreshing add on to the many delivery restaurants. They have a different menu everyday, which is nice. Most if the Italian/Chinese stuff I've had has been quite satisfying. I used to love the veg quesadillias they used to make before. The quality seems to have gone down now. Had a bad experience with soups, they were watery and seemed to be made very hastily. One of the rice-chicken dishes I ordered for my dad was overseasoned with salt and was almost inedible. On the upside,  the pesto pasta was creamy and brilliant. Nasi goreng rice was an upper too.",3.5

The menu on the website seemed very inviting and wanted to try another delivery setup for a while. The packaging of the food was very good and the portions were decent as well. However, they managed to goof up the order when they missed the non-veg section of the order and duplicated the veg order. This resulted in the delivery guy taking back even the Veg dish and took another 20 minutes in returning with the correct order. Sad part was that the veg dish wasn't reheated or replaced with a fresher package and we had to settle for a luke warm meal instead.",3.5

"Ordered from Fresh Menu last night. Have been a huge fan of their food and their menu. Have been an ardent customer of theirs too. but they disappointed me to such an extent last night that i wont think i will ever order from them again. i placed an order, received a message saying that it was out for delivery at 10.30 pm. i was sitting and waiting for the food to come till 12 am. called their help desk and of course no one picked up the phone. there was no message regarding the cancellation or non service of the order from their end. So basically i ended up waiting till 1 am and had to go to bed with no food. Thank you Fresh Menu for learning the art of serving your loyal customers so well. Basic courtesy is something that you guys need to develop and learn. Next time if you are going to do this to a customer, please remember to notify them as someone is trusting you for their food.",1.0

"Fresh is a very challenging word in today's processed and post processed food world! However, since they are only claiming a fresh menu they may be forgiven for giving impression that food is also fresh. Their delivery was pretty fast and full marks for it. But, the pasta I ordered was under-cooked and blander than expected, the white sauce tasted of milk more than cheese and I had to spice it up and steam it before I liked it.¬† The diced chicken dish was relatively well done. Another aspect that pricked me was the plastic container plates in which these food items come. Besides the associated health issues of food in plastic, isn't it too much of non-biodegradable garbage for one meal?",3.0

Freshmenu is a chain of online food service and keeps changing their menu everyday. I ordered Cantonese chicken leg with rice. The food tasted good but the only thing I didn't like is that they did not mention in their food details that the chicken would be with skin.

Fresh Menu is here for good. They home deliver mostly continental food and I have been one of their regulars for quite a while. They have an evolving menu which is great. Having tried many of their different dishes I would confirm they are pretty impressive. The fish dishes have been mostly good so has the chicken. In pasta I would like to see maida being replaced by wheat. Also you could discontinue your burger as its terrible. However bar the burger the menu is impressive. 4.0/5,4.0

Absolutely tasteless, which does no justice to its name or the description put up on the website. There were about two-three pieces of boiled sweet potato and a whole lot of capsicum. The dressing was totally bland. It had no seasoning and was like a white tasteless paste poured on a whole lot of capsicum. Totally disappointed and a complete waste of money.",3.5

"This review is based on my experience of ordering this time. Usually the food quality, quantity and taste is good. I have ordered from here many many times and I usually am quite satisfied with my order. So I had ordered the Kung Pao chicken rice bowl for lunch today. I was sadly disappointed as it was too oily and the taste was average but tolerable. What I hated most was that they had put some kind of salad with peanut butter on top of it and there was waaaay too much peanut butter. The taste was really over powering and it was mixed with the rice and the chicken and it's gravy and totally ruined the taste of the meal. I think that they should have an option on their website that asks, ""Do you or do you not want this god awful thing we call a salad to be scattered all over your food""? Also I noticed that they do have a lot of expensive ingredients in that salad. I really really wish they asked before they add it on as I am sure there would be a lot of people who would just throw it away and waste it.",2.5

Fresh Menu is one of the finest online food service i have come across. I ordered for Malaysian style Cottage Cheese with Aromatic Rice & Sayur Lodeh! Both the dishes were excellent and definitely worth a try. The food presentation truly deserves a 10 on 10 ! The quality of food is excellent. You definitely cannot resist the aroma! I Strongly recommend Fresh Menu! Good going ...,4.5
"Have ordered from freshmenu.com. a few times now. Whatever I have ordered has been outstanding. The burgers are out of this world, huge not like the teeny burgers you get at other places. Packing is great. Delivery is very fast and food is delivered hot. The desserts are also yummy.  Have recommended them to my friends and they too loved it.",5.0
"Great food, Prompt delivery, Good on the pocket, an interesting changing menu and courteous delivery personnel make it a treat to order food from here. The most I was surprised with were their desserts and cakes. I am truly a fan and always look for an opportunity to order from freshmenu!!",5.0
I had the most tasteless brownie ever. Thanks to my first order from Freshmenu. I heard a lot about their service which was actually prompt. But their food was not worth it. I haven't tried their other dishes yet but this was seriously some bad tasting dessert.,1.0
"Sad to see that Freshmenu taste and quality is slowly deteriorating. I myself had rated them 5 once upon a time. But, they have been unable to maintain that consistency. The dinner √£nd sandwiches we ordered over the last couple of months turned out to be starting to stale and had a foul smell. Simply no flavour and no value for money ! They also need to add some new dishes to their menu as their main course is becoming repetitive and boring with nothing new to offer. Their big sized burger is also a huge let-down !",2.5
Pathetic delivery services..,1.0
"Freshmenu.com is one of the few online delivery services which does not compromise on quality and freshness of your food. They serve a variety of cuisines ranging from Continental to Chinese to Thai and also the occasional spin on pasta (Italian). Their salads are equally delightful and refreshing as are the desserts. My favourites here are the Thai Fish green curry, Stuffed chicken, Nasi Goreng, Citrusy Chicken salad and also watch out for the cookies which are delicious! Their food never disappoints and big ups for not using additives or MSG in the food! :)",4.0
"So this happened now twice, the order had come nearly after 1 hr 30 mins, that's ridiculous for only-a-home-delivery-service, PATHETIC!!! And worst part is they don't even inform there customers, they picked their phone at my 3rd attempt, so no-thanks freshmen for spoiling my Saturday night, never again, good riddance!!",1.0
You guys are amazing üòÄ exotic food at pocket friendly prices. The taste of each of the dishes available beats even d most swankiest restaurants in bangalore..with each day different menu.. Salads are just d right balance.. And the main course just blows u Everytm..  The lamb dish my personal favourite.  with d resent introduction of cookies and cakes u sure are taking the right to many happy tummies...üòù.. Thnk u for being my saviour at all times.,5.0
"When one wants to sit home and enjoy a cafe sort American/Italian food then must order from freshmenu. I have had my dinner thrice regularly from them and every day new menu pleased me. Be it chicken, mutton or fish everything is so well cooked and tasty. I wish you guys were in new Delhi. I love your food. It's outstanding. Three Cheers ?",5.0
"The Mega burger these guys serve is AMAZING! It has very quickly become my most ordered food. It comes with a generous helping of wedges and tastes very good. I have ordered other stuff also from them. They have till now maintained a fairly high quality standard for their food. Only downside is the time they take and hence the lost star. Anyway, keep up the good work guys. You are are truly changing the Gourmet Food Delivery scene here in Bangalore.",4.0

"Tried the mojo marinated fish with Cuban rice . The  quantity they give you is enough for a woman controlling portions ! It may not fill a hungry man""s stomach .......but the quantity isn't meager . It's a healthy portion of fish and rice that was well spiced and cooked appropriately . I can't wait to try something else soon . I hope you maintain your standards FRESH MENU . Keep up the good work !",4.0
Food gets delivered late with bare minimum quantity. The spoons and forks aren't even wrapped in a cover and are brought in an open bag through the Bangalore traffic. Slowly the quality of FreshMenu is going bad.,1.0

"Ordered Crisp Babycorn in Hoisin & Chilli (veg) and Sliced Roast Lamb in Hot Bean Sauce with Noodles. Lets talk the good first... prompt service. .. love the taste. the lamb was cooked well and the Babycorn was very well made. They really need to improve on packing, the lamb hot bean sauce was leaking, the food was not packed correctly, looks like someone was in a hurry. The delivery man tried his level best to make use of the tissues but it eventually dripped on the floor... And¬†yeah no bill was provided...",3.5
"This place never disappoints!!! The food is amazing. I ordered the BBQ Chicken Mega burger and trust me! It's ""Mega"" alright! The food is fresh and hot. Freshmenu.com has become a new favourite among my colleagues too and ordering from there has  become a weekly occurrence. It's the anticipation about the next day's menu that (never ever ceases to amaze us) makes it even more fun.",5.0

"Ordered a Tex-Mex Chicken Burger on a lazy Sunday afternoon, delivered approximately in 30 mins. The patty was very thick but the product details has jalapenos ¬†which i felt were missing. The size of the burger was appreciable but the bun wasn't grilled. Potato wedges which were the side dish were disappointing. The packaging was good and made an excellent first impression.",3.5

"I am not the kind of person to review or rate places easily. But my experience with FreshMenu has been superb every time. Their food is always well presented and delicious and on time. That makes me not think about the few extra bucks that I would spend on them. Also, their customer service is very good. The person in the phone always talks nicely and they've always attended to every query satisfyingly.",5.0
Warning!!! Don't get carried away by the images show in the website.. They are completely fake compared to the fud delivered.. Ordered twice in this website.. First tym food never got delivered inspire of calling the management several times.. Second time food got delivered in 10 min.. I dono wn they cooked it.. Food was not warm..Corn kebabs wr soggy.. Pesto pasta was very dry.. Waste of money..,1.0
"Fresh Menu  is exactly what its name says ! Its fresh , it has a daily changing menu and damn its awesome ! The food is great , packaging is good and even the presentation is good...

My husband and I are huge fans of Freshmenu. It is our go-to ordering place on a lazy weekend when we are not up for going out. Here are the top 2 reasons why we always have Freshmenu as our #1 food ordering option -,4.0
"With its ubiquity in every food discussion and food blogs, I decided to give Fresh Menu a try, on a lazy Saturday afternoon! My taste buds were tingling with anticipation and thankfully, they did not keep me waiting. The food was delivered hot and fresh in just 20 mins!  I was mightily impressed by their prompt service, packing and perfect looks of the food. I had ordered grilled chicken with herbed rice flavored with dry fruits. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the aroma of the rice filled the room. Overall, it was a gourmet delivered at an affordable price and was indeed a gastronomic pleasure. Looking forward to order more!",4.0
Food: 4/5,3.5
"Placed a order at 2:30pm and they had it delivered at 3pm, what more can you ask when the food arrives on time? This place is the perfect solution for bad cafeteria lunches, and those who dont have the time to have a decent meal outside. The greek russian salad I ordered was pretty tasty except it had a little too much of capsicum(not sure if thats how it is) and for the mains I ordered spaghetti and shredded chicken which was cooked perfectly.",4.0
"Typical of Bangalore these days it was drizzling few days back. Being the super lazy person I am, I thought of trying Freshmenu which has been in my radar for quite a while. The menu card in Zomato suggests that all dishes are priced at Rs 250 which made me hesitant to try them. However, on checking their website I found that they have many other dishes.",2.5
"How many restaurants had ogling photos posted daily? How many restaurants keep changing their menu so that you don't get bored? How many chefs can properly prepare¬†Continental food? An awesome initiative. A hats off to whoever decided the menu daily! And the best part it, the main course always fills you how hungry you are. The first time i ordered two assuming the quantity would be insufficient. A good mix of Thai, Mexican, salads, burgers and desserts. Perhaps you can fix one or two dishes from each cuisine daily. Right now it's more like 1 chicken, 1 fish, 1 burger, 2 mousse ..or something similar. Also keep the domain within these cuisines, don't dilute it with indian (oriental) spicy dishes (chaats) that keep popping up sometimes.",4.5
"When you are a bachelor and its a Friday evening, after a tiring week mostly you would want to eat good food at your home. And Freshmenu provides you with that option. Ordered Pasta from them. They delivered it pretty quickly and the food was pretty warm and fresh. And more importantly the food was good and tasty. The delivery person was pretty nice guy. The food packing was also pretty good. A good option to order from when you are looking for healthy food.",4.0
"Ordered in off the website on a rainy lazy murky Blore afternoon. Delivery took some time. Packing and portions both were good. Thai Green curry Fish with Basil rice was fresh fragrant, all things good & thai! Fish was soft. Cajun Chicken burger was a huge burger! I like my burgers big and that itself earns them full marks. Bun was fresh and burger seasoned well. Last was the chicken 3 salad or something like that. Good tangy sweet dressing. I was happy to see the salad fresh. Not the wilted lettuce (aka McDs) and wrinkled bell peppers you would fear.",4.5
I ordered Thai fish green curry with basil rice and grilled cottage cheese steak with Sicilian caponata & herb rice. The packaging and the delivery were awesome. Clean and neat packaging. They delivered in about 20 mins after I placed my order.,4.0
"Food: Quality has detoriated over the last 6-8 months drastically, Mix of food has moved more towards rice or noodles. quantity of chicken or fish has decreased and quantity of rice/pasta hs increased. Earlier it used to be lot of vegetables now the quantity of that has decreased.",1.5
"Good food . This place serves a vast variety of food n excellent option when in a hurry, but individually each dish is not excellent . Although the burgers are the best I have eaten n the list includes burgers from truffles but the price of a single burger being Rs250 is üò±üò±üêìüêì. I hope they improve the flavours of individual dishes n the prices . Good job freshmenu !!!!!!!!",3.5
Ordered Pad Thai and Pasta Arrabiata....both were blah at best. ¬†Pad thai was bordering on tasteless and the arrabiata was marginally better. ¬†Will not order again. ¬†Try Chef Kraft.....ordered their thai chicken salad and it was excellent....waiting to try the other items.,2.5
"After weeks of scamming nibbles off my colleagues Freshmenu meals, I finally went ahead and ordered a meal box of my own last Friday. Let's just say that it was nearly impossible to keep my eyes open for the second half of my day at work after that ridiculously awesome meal. I'd ordered the seafood pasta in white sauce and it was absolutely decadent. The only thing that wasn't really upto the mark in the meal box was the pasta salad which was way too dry but since the main was pasta anyway, that became pretty insignificant.",4.5
"A delightful new concept offering a new multicuisine menu everyday was enough to nudge me into trying freshmenu out. And I wasn't disappointed!! Tasty food, perfect delivery time, convenient packaging..all of it makes freshmenu my current favourite. When hunger strikes..give this place a shot!",4.0
"I have been following their site for quite some time. Yet somehow did not place an order until now. Grilled fish with noodles and Portuguese style grilled chicken with herb rice . I am more than impressed by the fast delivery service- food arrived within 20 minutes of placing the order. The arrival of neatly packed food is definitely a thumbs up. Simplistic menu- fresh, well flavoured, correctly spiced and good portions. One of the few places delivering good continental cuisine at such low prices.",4.5
Fresh menu is my saviour as I simply cannot eat the food at my office. I like the variety that they offer though it is a lil pricey for eating every day. The portions are very large and most of the food is decent.,4.0
"Ordered from them a couple of times and have been happy almost all the times. There was one time they mixed up the order, but they were nice enough to go back and get back my order and this was done in 15 minutes. Great Quality food...Only ask, is to reduce the Chinese options as that seems to be there most commonly. Now i love Chinese food, but they are not the healthiest option. Would love to see more of Continental stuff in there...or probably even one healthy meal option everyday... Another observation is that I have seen a drop in quantity over time. Now i am fine with that however, then the price looks a bit steep for that quantity. So one of these things needs to be fixed. But overall a great job!!! Great model and i hope you keep the quality where it is!!!",4.0
Horrible.  One word to describe the food from freshmenu. Ordered schezwan noodle bowl and another noodle combo for dinner. Both were almost stale and cold.  Disappointed to the core. I think they prepare the days menu in the morning and keep giving it till night. There was some smell also coming from the food. Noodles were are stuck up together like a cake or something.  Sorry freshmenu. U have lost it.,1.0
Well... what do i say... Fresh menu disappoints me yet again!!!,1.0
"Horrible service. Ordered once, first of all, the pin code should indicate where they can deliver.  They take the money online, take the order. Then I get a call, I've ordered at 6:45 in the evening, it's not that late in the evening. I'm told that they have too many orders, and they can't deliver. I also told them I've ordered for the first time. All I get from the person, we're too busy. I was recommended by someone else, will never make an order again.",1.0

"Horrible experience. One time the food they delivered was cold but after having eaten it, we had stomach upsets..after giving them",1.0
"I had the Freshmenu lunch during a recent event in bangalore last weekend. They had served mexican rice bowl for close to 150 people who had convened for the event. And the food was in a very very sorry state. Not only was it uncooked, it was also nearly cold the time it reached the venue. Close to 120 of us had to waste the food though we were really really hungry! Hope they don't repeat this.",1.0
I ordered through their android app. After confirming the order I realized that there was no possible way to recheck the order  or cancel the order.,4.0

"FreshMenu...they get to keep the name..I approve. Fresh food..no grease and great portion..Ultimate taste..so the perfect combo. They floored us with on time delivery first time..and every time we ordered. The pasta is no less to a fancy restaurant and i am happy they keep their promise. Each meal is served with a salad and a side, which makes it a lesser hassle to break your head on combinations..and they work pretty well as a wholesome meal..The food scene on home delivery front has changed..When i order continental, i actually get continental food and not an indianised version of it. Which itself is such a relief...Authentic and good food...Packaging could be a little better as i got the cutlets floating in the sauce one day..again, ignorable as they still tasted great..Big thumps up and great going...",4.5
"Finally the perfect solution to office lunch problems. Great portions, Yummy to the Tummy and most of all non-greasy and healthy.",4.5
"Heard about it so much from friends, but was not really that much great. We got the delivery like in 15 minutes so was happy with that, but everything was so cold and the starter was so cold that even heating it was not giving any life to it. The main course pasta was fine but overall not a very good experience.",2.5
"STALE menu! That's review enough. Got fungus free with my sandwich. Colleagues have previously found hair, wooden pieces etc. 0 food standards. Disgusting. And no response to make up for such terrible service!",1.0
"Ordered a salad, sandwich and a dessert. Simple lunch, refreshing taste, not very pricey. Quick service, with good packing. Must try if you are in one of their delivery locations.",3.5
"This was the worst experience that I've had. Firstly they took more than an hour to deliver the food. Secondly they delivered the wrong main course. Thirdly when I finally managed to get through the mobile number that they've mentioned on the net, I was told they'll check with the delivery guy and the kitchen, and get back, which they didn't. Fourthly the food isn't worth the wait, its just average or probably below average (something similar to what we'd get at the office cafeteria). So all in all, I can quite safely say that my first order will definitely be my last order. If I ever think of thinking of ordering from FreshMenu, I'll just go to the store and buy myself a pack of Maggie.",1.0
"Just the option ive been looking for.Finally some reasonable gourmet healthy non greasy food with options changing every day. The service was awesome, got my food within half hour.

"I was so excited to order from Freshmenu for the first time. To my disappointment, the service is so stupid. I had to call them up a number of times. The delivery boy took one hour to reach from one end of the lane to my place and when he came the order was wrong. Pathetic experience.",1.0

"I never get the order on time and i always have to call them, if my order is even coming but the food is great. Food really is fresh and delicious. 3 is because of the delivery time as its always more than an hour.",4.5
"Went for their 5-day salad-subscription. Some amount of negotiation was needed to ensure delivery around 8pm instead of their regular salad-slot, since I wanted to make the salad my dinner (with little soup n bread). But that was done.The salads were superb! Right quantity. Well cooked. Fresh. And the non-creamy (low cal) dressings. Only request was the number of chickpea repeats in a week are reduced.Guys... if you start similar 5-day lunch-subscription (mains) at as lucrative a subscription scheme, I will completely stop cooking + cook + provisions-buying!! (Many years ago my wife had said that 7 families should stay together and have a common kitchen; I don't mind cooking for 7 families but only 1 day a week! With FreshMenu, it CAN become Zero!)",4.5
"While the food is fantastic (and hence the 2), the service is pathetic. I have tried ordering from them a total of 7 times and actually got food from them 3 times. That speaks volumes. I have all sorts of troubles with their websites and apps where I make the payment and the money gets deducted but the order doesn't get placed (happened twice). Other times order can't be placed because its a ""duplicate order"". Most annoying was today when after placing order I got a call saying sorry we have closed. Shouldn't the website have been closed? Also, try calling their helpline and 9 out of 10 times they will not pick it up. And the 3 times when I have actually managed to get food from them, it has come any time between 45 minutes to 1.5 hours!",2.0

Good service - received delivery without having to follow up multiple times on status. Food was packed well and was fresh. Quantity was generus. Menu keeps on rotating without being monotonic. Would recommend to anyone thinking of having good reasonably priced at home without having to travel and go through hassles of queues of dine-in without any pre booking.,4.5

We happened to chance upon fresh menu while looking for delivery service and we were not disappointed at all!,3.5
I have to order from freshmenu at least once every week. When I'm at work or feeling too lazy to cook at home. A huge fan of their fish dishes! Great food at great prices! Would highly recommend them to everyone.,4.5
"Rave reviews on Zomato...and on a lazy afternoon, finally got around to trying. We ordered a Thai green fish curry and a chicken dish which apparently drew inspiration from New Orleans. The order was delayed by a good one hour from the time promised. A couple of phone calls later, the phone rep was polite enough to offer our meal as complimentary. Nice touch but better without the wait! The packaging was done well and the portions were just right for one person. The Thai green fish curry tasted great, the delicate basa had absorbed the fragrant spices. However, the chicken dish left much to be desired. It tasted almost like tomato rice with bland sausages carelessly thrown in. Forgettable, very. Also, for the food, I thought 250INR, per dish was expensive even when you consider the delivery advantage. Would I order again? Perhaps.",3.5
Always been reliable so far and what I love is the no-nonsense simple menu which changes everyday!,4.0
Given the fact I'm a new mom I rarely get to go out for continental food. But freshmenu.com is like a dream come true. I get to eat such amazing food at my house n spend more time with my baby. The salads n main meals are too good with great quantity. Keep it up!!,4.5
Edit: 15th May.,4.0
"Just ordered for the first time from FreshMenu after hearing a friend rave about it. I ordered Vegetarian Pan-fried Noodles with Sweet & Sour (INR 200) and it was damn good. The crunchiness was intact and the soup warm when delivered, and it was among the best Chinese I have had in Bangalore (or maybe I was just hungry?).",5.0
I called for a vegetarian khow suey at 7 pm on a bored Monday night. The food arrived in 30 mins and was packed really well. The box itself looked appealing: no food spillage nothing. The cutlery provided was sturdy too. Taste wise I wish the food lived up to my expectations. It was a 3/5 while I was expecting much much more. The price is super reasonable. An entire meal was for 200 Rupees which was a steal. Will try out new stuff from FreshMenu again. And the menu changes everyday which is an amazing thing!,3.5
A new form of service in the best way possible. I have ordered twice within a span of 3 days. The variety is good. It covers mostly all the food groups. It does not leave the vegetarians out... The best is even with so many things happening in the plate there is no spillage. So it is not messy and you can taste every individual component. Everyday is a new tempting menu...I am surely getting addicted to it...Keep up the good work guys...and start delivering in more places.,4.5
"An excellent service with moderately priced, delicious food perfect for when one is over the usual dal-chawal and wants something different.",4.5
"FreshMenu is what a lazy foodie like me had always wished for! They serve a variety of cuisines, with a new menu every day, at very reasonable prices, hygienically packed and delivered to you within 45 minutes. If that is not exciting enough for you, I don‚Äôt know what else is!",4.5
"As the trend of online food delivery is catching up, I can safely say that Freshmenu is one of the topnotch websites in this industry and is doing an amazing job at it! Right from the way the food has been presented on the website, the layout of the pictures and details, the first communication you have with them, the service and the packaging, everything is rather impressive and will almost take you by surprise the first time you receive your order.",4.5
"Waited 2 hours. I have eaten from here before and the food is good. But I am not waiting like that again. I called many times only to be told ""10 mins more"" ""15 mins more"" without even actually checking to see how much time it would actually take. Maybe informing the customer ahead of time should be part of the process? You have the list of pending orders right in front of you. Me being in the same industry, I know how important good service is and I break my back trying to go over and above my capacity to give better service at all times to everyone. This is a classic example of a service that is growing too fast without proper infrastructure and management.",1.0

"Just sent back the delivery (12 Apr, 2015) that was attempted after 2.5 hrs! Promise is of 45 minutes. A call an hour after the order and we were told it had left the kitchen. No info thereafter. Another call after another half hour and we were bumped off by phone system due to high call volumes! We finally gave up and ate leftovers at home. Nothing ""fresh"" about that!! Granted it is a rainy day and a Sunday. But the least they can prepare themselves for is to tell waiting hungry customers that they are not able to deliver. Alas this was our first experience and they have already lost us as a customer.",1.0
"When I arrived in Bangalore freshmenu was the only place I ate from. Unfortunately, over the last month or so the quality of the food (which was its biggest draw) has started to go down. Too much pepper in rice, too dry salads, less fish in the curry... Things that probably came from scaling. However, the customer support is good and quite helpful so overall a 3.5 from me. I want this to be 5/5 so bad, which probably disappoints me more when expectations are not met.",3.5
"I've ordered from Fresh Menu twice now and both times the food is really good. I like that I have reasonable option for home delivery of continental food. Also, the minimum order is for one person, so it works well. The only thing is most times I don't get through them on the phone so online is the almost the only option. They should fix this phone number - it says connecting, then says we have taken down your number and will call you back but nothing happens after.",4.0
Amazing food variety and the presentation is always outstanding. I enjoy the food from this place every time. Service is also very good and swift.,5.0

Food is definitely tasty... No doubt..... But the quantity is very very less as per the price... The menu is good for snacks in the evening or just a filler between the meals. If you want to eat as a meal then the quantity is very less. My kids also found the quantity of pasta less and they wanted more of it. I had ordered individually two packs for my two children but that was not sufficient.... So you can well imagine what a small quantity they serve....,3.5

Has a long way to go, but this definitely is future for food industry. The App is user friendly and easy to use. One bug i noticed is that the address I entered does not seem to get stored, also i would prefer the option to see my order history. The App will notify that days menu, just select your choice and there you go. Within 30 mins, smacking hot tasty food delivered at your door steps. I have had their pasta, spaghetti, chicken and fish dishes. Its well priced at 250 for the main course, 100 for salads, 50 for desserts. I have not tried their appetizers yet. I found the food packing to be very good, though once my friend got a package which was leaking.",4.5

Soooper fresh food and super quick delivery :) I just ordered online and it was like the food was delivered by magic..instantly :)...This is what I said first but now as a regular there have been many times when the food is stale and delivery not upto the mark.,3.5
"I have ordered plenty of times and will continue to do so. I love the food. The oriental noodles is very sphagetti like and usually becomes pretty mishmashed by the time it is delivered. Seen this happen twice and would strongly advise not to order any oriental noodle related dish. Since this is a home delivery model, they need to get their delivery right. Most delivery boys employed by them are super incompetent so please be advised that you may have to answer some very frustrating phone calls.. even if it is the tenth time you are ordering.  Food quality is on par with the best gourmet restaurants and the packaging is as good as eating at a restaurant itself. I will be ordering here very often.",5.0

"Ordered for the first time from ‚Ä™#‚Äéfreshmenu‚Ä¨ at around 7:44 pm this evening and food was delivered at 10:20 pm! couple of suggestions here - 1) do not advertise the 45 minute delivery time on your website and fool customers 2) at least have the decency to call the customer and notify him/her that the order is delayed 3) train your delivery staff to communicate with the customer in case he needs to be directed to the address and also be sensitive to the customer (the guy was happily whistling/singing and said 'sorry sir, food is free') I want good service for which I am more than happy to pay for! making my order a complimentary one earns you 0 brownie points btw..4) stop blatantly lying that the order is out for delivery and its the traffic that caused the delay (delivering from CMH road to Indiranagar cannot take 3 hours despite Bangalore traffic being the way it is!) Not sure what your business model is, but pretty confident it's not sustainable.. word of mouth goes a long way and you would know better than me...absolutely unpleasant experience, extremely disappointing portions of food and appalled by the callousness...0 points from me, but since I have to give a rating I have given 1!",1.0

I am impressed. Delivery on my doorstep 10 mins after order is placed online. Flavours all intact. Loved all dishes ordered. Battered squid may not be a good idea since it came soggy.

I very rarely get wowed by food, but FreshMenu seems to have nailed it. The food is also packed neatly and ready to eat out of (neatly compartmentalised and packed with spoon/fork), so you don't have to do the dishes later. And it's quite filling as well. Quite simply the best fare I've had in a long time and will definitely try again.",5.0

A regular with them now for more than 6 months, I am a die hard fan of their sandwiches and desserts. The service is too good, the Unit manager Ashray Gowda has been always helpful and warming with his always smiling responses but seriousness in ensuring we get served the best good always.

The best food ordering app and my goodness what taste...truly these folks have been delivering healthy and organic food without any use of additives or coloring agents. Like the way they celebrate food. Currently the great burger festival is going on. Today ordered smoked chitpotle burger with crispy triangles. The food was mind blowing and was cooked to perfection. The best burgers on the offing. Go for it till the burger festival is on. The best burgers are served right her on freshmenu.,5.0
"I have ordered a few times from freshmenu. The food sometimes is great. Depends on the menu of course. All the items are not good. Sometimes i felt the food was not fresh, for ex I had ordered a veggie wrap which I didn't like so much. But overall a good experience. I really like their veg sandwiches, salads and desserts. I will definitely keep ordering.",3.5
"Orderd quite a few times and the food is fresh. Absolutely love their non veg sandwiches and desserts. But the snacks are usually served cold, which is irritating.The menu serves more of non veg items rather than veg. The delivery is right on time. The value is for money good for the mains but not worth it for the snacks.",3.0
"I have ordered quite a few times and like the idea of some new items everyday, rather than continuing with same one. The delivery is right on time and the food is presented very well. Coming to food, I am not that satisfied with the falafels and sandwiches. Once I ordered croissants and I didn't like it that much. It wasn't that crunchy, rather it felt ¬†leathery. Salads are a good deal, but quantity is less. I tried a lot of main courses, and some of the chicken items are really fabulous. Moroccan Chicken Steak, Pesto Grilled Chicken, Honey Glazed Chicken, Soy Oyster glazed Chicken ... to name a few were really good. I won't say the quantity is sufficient, considering the price and the packaging/presentation, its good enough.",3.5
"Although your food is great, I have to say that I really hate the sauce/ pickled vegetables that come along with the main course meals. Is there any way for customers to choose to not receive that particular side for every meal? Can they make it an option? Please? I don't like to throw away food, but that particular item is unbearable. It usually ends up ruining my mood to be forced to deal with it no matter what I order.",4.0

The ease of getting these unique and some really thoughtful dishes at your fingertips is in itself a thing to be glad for.

"An interesting concept of home delivery of food with daily changing menu. Their entire menu is non-Indian and almost all items are reasonably priced for the quality, quantity and service that they offer. The packaging of food is good and feels hygienic. It is very convenient to order when in office. They should more clearly mention the ingredients and mark all items with green (vegetarian) or red (non-vegetarian) color - they don't do it clearly for some items, especially the desserts/sweets and so I simply avoid those dishes as I am a vegetarian.",3.5

I order food 73mins. ago to be delivered in 60mins., which is already 13min. delayed and the customer care person says there is a technical error in accessing details of my order. It is as simple as that, the customer care is not in a position to tell the truth that the order can't be delivered in time. Freshmenu is just an online delivery service and they can't deliver in time which may not be an issue as long as they are in a position to commit some other time of delivery. WTH??",1.0

"I have had fresh menu once at a friend's place in White Field and thought of ordering today for my family. Ordered Greek salad, baked chicken steak , Moroccon chicken stew rice bowl and brownie dessert. We loved the food. I am a big salad fan and I just hogged on the bowl leaving some for my better half.:-) It was extremely fresh and crunchy. The mains were equally delicious. However the desert was not a brownie. I bake at home and it was rich chocolate cake with ganache. A wee bit disappointed as there were no walnuts too as shown in the pic. But all in all , relished the food. Great job freshmenu.",4.0

"Ordered non-veg for 2 persons, the order came right on time, took around 45 -50 minutes. Loved the taste, especially the fish, with the right level of spices.

"I have ordered from Freshmenu JP Nagar 3-4 times earlier. I have also ordered from their HSR unit. They were good, sometimes even exceptional. But last Saturday I ordered a Mexican Platter from JP Nagar. I got a call after 15 minutes apologizing as this item was sold out, even though it was showing as available on the webpage. They offered to substitute with any other item.I told them it was OK to cancel the order and it was not a problem. However, they called back after 10 minutes and told me that the item was now available. This was suspicious and should have been a red flag. But I went ahead and asked them to send it. It came quickly enough and I collected it after payment. But on opening, I found that the fries were cold and limp. One of the dips was positively old and spoilt. The main breaker was that the nachos which were in a plastic ziplock cover were crumpled and crushed to small pieces and also looked old and rancid, far from the nice healthy ones on the webpage. I called back the delivery person and asked him to take it back as we had opened it and closed it back. He told us that he was on another delivery and cannot come back. This is understandable. But I asked him to pick up the package on his return and take it even if he cannot repay the amount paid by us. He was not agreeable as this is something he was not trained to handle. A manager called me a few minutes later and apologized for this. But he refused to agree that nachos are expected to be crisp and freshly made, especially when charging Rs. 400 for it. He said it is a cold dish and we should not expect fresh nachos. I agreed that the dips are cold, but that does not mean nachos and fries can be old and soggy & also nachos served in tiny broken pieces, almost powdered in some cases. He still refused to accept this. But he offered a complimentary replacement as well as a waiver on what we paid. I told him a replacement was not necessary as we were past the time for a snack. He said he would send the money back for which I thanked him. I also asked him to have the package picked up to see for himself what I described. Two days later, I still have not seen either my money back, nor has the package been picked.",1.0

The poor rating might be a tad too harsh but the sheer disregard for a honest feedback is quite annoying...:",1.0
This site can be credited for truly bringing in the online food culture into vogue. The food is good and certainly worth the money they charge. Although I understand from my non veg food lovers that the taste for non veg is wanting. The time taken to deliver is something that really needs to be improved as there gave been instances where I have waited for 1.5 to 2 hours for the delivery. certainly room for improvement.,3.5
"My First experience wasn't that great . So was really skeptical about ordering again, But den few reviews gave me a thought to try again. So opted tricolour Pasta and veg dumplings with noodles . tricolour Pasta - tasted good but as its delivery , Pasta can be made bit  Saucy which would taste to perfect",3.5
The food tastes great and the portions offered are more than satisfying. The main advantages however are the cost effectiveness and the ease of placing an order. The orders are almost always promptly delivered on time. Worth a try for when you're in the mood to eat gourmet meals in the comfort of your own home.,4.0

Lovely food. Enjoyed the Italian Platter.,4.0
Actual Rating : 3.3. I like their concept. But menu is too limited. I guess adding 1-2 extra dishes wouldn't harm anyone? The paneer steak veg dish(don't remember full name) was descent with some room for improvement definitely. Paneer used was fresh and was plenty for a single person. The quickness of their service is commendable. At least i get the order delivered pretty fast. Veg dishes are limited and salads are rare on menu. I mean low calorie and healthy salads. Quantity can be slightly increased to be more competitive.,3.0
Yummy continental food at reasonable prices served hot to your dining table.,4.0
"The best part of freshmenu.com is that the simply exotic food from different parts of the world getting delivered at home while it is still hot at very reasonable prices. It does take 45min from the time we order but I don't mind waiting for it. Their pastas, salads, mini-burgers are all simply wonderful. Note that we have only tried their veg versions of it. They keep trying to change their menu but I think if you order say on Friday night it is mostly the same every Friday night. To try different food you have to change the day or time of ordering from lunch to dinner. I am hoping that as more folks start ordering their food they will add more variety to their menu for the same day of the week.",4.0

"From past couple of weeks, this has been a go to place for us. Quick order, even quicker delivery (most of the times), and quality food. Even though I had heard about this quite some time back, never had a chance to try it. But being busy this past few weeks made us try and made us totally happy. Firstly I tried the croquettes, beetroot mostly and minced veggies. Crunchy outside and nicely cooked beetroot with a tasty mayo kind of sauce. Along with it tried a dark chocolate tart. Apart from the ganache, it was totally disappointing. The tart was biscuity and lacked the smooth texture a tart base is supposed to have. For lunch the next time, we tried feta groomed stuffed bell peppers with herb rice and pasta in a vibrant red sauce. The herb rice tasted amazingly well with the stuffed pepper and feta cheese added little sweetness needed to the dish. The pasta, though looked subtle but tasted spicy. They served each of the starters and main course with a beetroot salad which was so light and fresh. Good stuff.",3.5
it stinks... the food is good.. but the delivery model stinks.. not sure if they are in 1900's or 21st century....wakeup startups... if you have a business model of 1900's u r deemed to sink... not sure who the investor's are ??? are they just putting money without understanding the model... easy money???,1.0
Not great but its good.,3.0

"In case u want to have ur home delivery be nothing short of awesome then Freshmenu is the best option .... Really nice food , served warm hot , delights u by the dynamic menu that they offer u everyday ... They surprise u everyday with something new something different .... If u r bored having the same kind of food everyday then Freshmenu provides u with a refreshing alternative .... If they can just deliver a bit early then it would have been a five star rating ...",4.0
Disappointed. Heard a lot about it and decided to give it a try. Beetroots that came as a salad tasted stale. The red sauce for the pasta was super sour. Felt like eating tomato puree. Weird proportions. Cottage steak was too much and barely any pasta. Steak was alright though.,2.0
Stale food.. Not very tasty and not worth the price.. Customer Care is not very responsive either. Was very disappointed. Won't order again.,1.0
"We have been getting the food from them right from the time they started. The food was awesome and have always enjoyed. But then when we called them yesterday they refused to deliver it to ISRO Layout, very disappointing and that too after their manager called to thank us for being their regular customers. would not recommend to any of my friends.",1.0
Used to order from Freshmenu all the time but then they refused to deliver to Banashankari stage 3. Very disappointed. Would not recommend it to friends!,2.0
This place is awesome the food was delivered on time. The food is tasty and very well prepared. Packing is great. Overall a 100% value for money. A must try if you like ordering at home.,4.5
"After quite a while, I tried a new place for lunch. And am I glad?",4.5
Quality is really good.  They should bring more cuisines into their menu.  Delivery is always prompt. Very much punctual. Overall it has been a pleasure ordering from @freshmenu.com,4.5
"My worst experience while ordering food from somewhere , even after two hours of ordering there is no sign of food anywhere ... It soo very dificult to reach there customer care , automated answer machine keeps hanging you up saying that all customer care executives are busy and if you get connected to someone they dont have any answer to your queries except saying consoling words like your order will be there in 5 mins and all .. Which never happens or they tell you they will get back to you after having a word with kitchen which also never happens ... As they will never get back to you . So please if you are ordering from this place , make sure you have some backup otherwise if there are some issues , you might not receive the order at all ...",1.5
I liked their food and service a lot. It is a great option for good and fresh food. They really do change their menu everyday. Some items may repeat after a particular period.,4.0
This place was introduced to me by a colleague last week. Finally I decided to give it a try. A couple of us at work ordered our lunch from here. The best part about Freshmenu is that it goes by its name. Everyday fresh new items in the menu.,4.0
The food is awesome.,4.5
A place I cannot get enough of. I have tried their yum dishes many times and they have always managed to impress me with their impeccable service and delivery. Their dishes are really good and I recommend this place to each and everyone I know. A must try if you are bored of the Indian food and want to try something different and affrodable sitting at home.,4.5
Ordered from this place on Sunday night. Food was delivered in 45 minutes. It was delivered in a nice plastic packing.,3.0

"Awesome food , management and delivery. Freshmen had disappointed me the last time due to their inability to deliver food due to rain, but they did an amazing job this time. Their mistakes can be ignored as they are still emerging and in fact getting better day by day . They are at the top from the concept, to the food quality. I ordered cottage cheese kababs , Thai veg curry with basil rice and Mexican veg sliders. Each dish was prepared with finesse and made my taste buds go through a tough time in deciding on which flavour is the best as the food was flavoursome. Coming to their website, it's getting better and more responsive day by day. I had no issues while using the site or the app. Overall, it's a must try for all the food enthusiasts who are willing to give these guys a shot and make other food chains sweat. I would like to give my warm regards to their chefs especially the chef/chefs of JP Nagar kitchen. I hope all the other chefs of other kitchens are equally good. I hope their quality doesn't deteriorate by time like many other food chains as their concept of dynamic menu is unique and outstanding.",5.0
"Absolutely impressed! Great food, great service. Ordered 4 times already :)",4.0
"It was going good initially. Have been ordering for 2-3 weeks. Got my first bad delivery. Food was stale and cold. Starters felt cold. Veg sliders felt like something from last night being passed on. Called them up. Good part they were willing to replace promptly. But if this becomes the norm, it would be a disappointment.",2.0
"Good food, extremely fair prices, good packing too, but what's the point. The delivery is poor. Well over an hour and a half late on 1 occasion (I have ordered only 4 times) and the second time the main course was missing despite the dispatch email confirming the correct order. I dunno....",2.5
The concept is great and the execution lives up.,5.0
"On a lot of insistence of my best friend, who is only praises about them, I finally ordered from them.",4.5
"Right off the bat, it is awesome that you can ask for a specific delivery time and they will stick to it. That's the way to run an only delivery restaurant.",2.5
"Freshmenu is an amazing venture to start of with... They lay out a new menu everyday through their app.. Variety is in plenty.. Chinese, Oriental and Continental  dishes!!  One of the best things about the food is it is as delicious  and appealing as it looks on their menu...Each dish is crafted to perfection! Coming to service and delivery it is prompt most times..",4.0
"Fresh and yummy food at a decent price. Also, liked their concept of new menu everyday. I had ordered for BBQ chicken sandwich, the bread and the vegetables were fresh and the sandwich was yummy!!",3.5
"I placed my order at around 9.50 pm. Waited for delivery of my order for 1 hour 20 minutes and finally decided to call them to check if they had cancelled my order without informing me. I was told they would call me back in ""2 minutes"" after checking with their kitchen. As expected nobody called back and my order was never delivered.",1.0

Their daily changing menu excites me !! no more boring same routine salads, I like to try new salads daily !!! ..... Thanks freshmenu ...",5.0
"Fresh Menu is god sent! All these years I struggled to get decent food delivered at my home in Jayanagar and I finally have fresh menu to the rescue . I saw a post on fb where some one suggested freshmenu to a friend, without wasting much time I quickly went to the website and everything looked so delectable ! So I ordered veg dumplings in garlic sauce with fried rice and Middle Eastern chicken skewers. The food arrived within 20 mins of ordering. The packaging was amazing and the food was beyond compare. I frankly have my standards of Chinese set sky high , but fresh menu did more than justice to it! Non greasy and brilliant flavours ! I haven't tasted such great food in a while now . I will definitely recommend freshmenu. I am going to be a loyal customer here :)",5.0

Been to my friends place and we were thinking of what to order for a late night munch. We found Freshmenu and ordered a roast chicken and mushroom sandwich along with a Asian noodle salad. The sandwich was well made in focaccia bread and pesto sauce topping. They had crispy potato and a cherry tomato salad on the side. The Asian noodle salad was spicy beyond expectation and did not give the 'salad' feel. The delivery wasn't as prompt as it was in Marathahalli. However the food wasn't cold. Will try again...,3.5

Ordered on 16th order number is 31277. Got confirmation from Sumit that it's confirmed but finally the JP Nagar kitchen said that there was no such order and they are closed for the day. I called Sumit to check on this and he never got back to me. Very poor customer service and does not reflect the high values as stated in Freshmenu website.,1.0
"1 of the best start up's in food industry I will say.  I have eaten salads and desserts only till date. Very fresh and tasty. I found a spoilt fruit in 1 of the salads and when I gave them the feedback, They took it positively and sent me a new and fresh salad. Good and prompt service. At times, delivery has got delayed. Worth a try.",3.5
Order at your own risk.. If you are lucky you might get the food or you will just have to fill your stomach looking at the picture.,1.0
"I saw the app and I really liked the variety that they offered on the menu and decided to order dinner from here. We ordered honey mustard grilled cottage cheese mushroom sandwich, khow suey noodle bowl and pickled cottage cheese cigars. We got chocolate and strawberry mousse for free and were asked to review them on zomato. So here I am doing that. I didn't like the food one bit, nothing tasted good or even edible for that matter. The food on the app looks brilliant but it doesn't look or taste half as good. Utterly disappointed. Will never order from freshmenu again.",1.0
My first order and I'm Quite Disappointed. I got the order 90 minutes late. Food(Thai basil rice) was lukewarm and tasted just OK. I'm not sure if ill try again.,1.0
"I am not a person, who would order food and get it delivered, but there are times when you are at work and I remember reading reviews about Freshmenu from zomato. I totally loved the app, website and cash on delivery concept. Different dishes almost every day ranging from appetizers, salads and main course. I had also called them couple of times to order food, instead of placing order through website. Very helpful staff on phone which is appreciated.",4.0

Ordered twice.,2.5
Excellent! Very happy with the promptness and the taste of the food! I would like you'll to include a little more details such as ingredients and exact quantity on the app plus have an option to cancel the order within 5 minutes.

Found these guys online when we were simply browsing thru. Their site felt like a finding wonder and that kept me wondering if their food really tasted the way it looked.,4.5

For the foodie I am I ordered tom yum chicken noodles, chilli basil fish croqqettes and asian noodle salad and got a moose free.

I ordered dinner from freshmenu yesterday. Let me start with the good part first:,5.0
"I had ordered a veg sandwich and corn cakes yesterday. I was delivered a non-veg sandwich. When I called to inform the same, the concerned person said she will get back to me in some time and was very confident that they have delivered the right order. Even when she called back she was still confident that you had delivered veg but offered to send another veg sandwich (as a favor !!). The staff who attended was totally unapologetic and overconfident that a mistake can happen from your end. Only because the sandwich was cut diagonally !!!! When the delivery boy came back with aa veg sandwich i checked in front him and I had received a veg order. I showed the delivery boy the previous order. Even before he saw the previous box he was also overconfident that it was Veg only !!!! And unfortunately to his surprise it was non-veg !! He even agreed after seeing it. I gave the previous order back and asked him to show it the staff who spoke to me so that she can also see what was delivered. Later on in the night when I went for a walk, I was surprised to see the empty box thrown in front of my house. First all I do not know if the delivery boy consumed the non-veg sandwich !! He also had the audacity to litter in front of my house. Till now there has been no apologies from your end for this mistake. For a strict vegetarian like me it is very hurtful for what I have been through. More than that too see the audacity and overconfidence in your staff. I wonder If I will order ever again !!",1.0

Looking forward to savour and explore other delicacies!",4.0
"Not sure how I first came across Fresh Menu, but oh boy! am I glad that I did. On those days when I have stayed back at home, my main concern is lunch. While KFC and pizzas are an easy, fast option, the thought of having it again only makes me regret skipping office. On the other hand, ordering from other restaurants turns out to be time taking and sometimes even expensive. Enter FreshMenu.com with it's high quality, fresh, hot, tasty food in less than half an hour (that's faster than even Dominos Pizza).",5.0

Got a chance to order from Fresh Menu since they have opened in JP Nagar they were kind enough to deliver to Jayanagar. The concept was something which I liked as the menu is refreshed every day and thought it would be a good idea to order on a Friday as I had just returned from a long travel and craving for good food. Promptly placed the order online (thanks to Ajay) to get it piping hot and on schedule.,4.5
"FREHMENU !!! Menu is fresh , food preparation is fresh , delivery well on time .. Lovely Packaging to keep food warm and make customer gorge as soon as food is delivered.

"I am a frequent customer of Fresh Menu and in love with the sandwiches they deliver. A few things that make Fresh Menu stand out is, No min order value. I can order one sandwich.

I love Freshmenu. There are no other words i would used to describe it. The food is absolutely scrumptious and exotic. I mean the food as good as the food you would find in any 5 start hotel just served in paper plates. I have tried so many other websites but nothing matches upto it. I religious follow the page to look at it atleast once a day if not buy everyday.,4.5

"Disappointing service twice. A few weeks back I ordered a burger and it was delivered almost frozen. Today again i placed an order for tofu with noodles and it was delivered with rice. Since this was for the kids and they wanted to have noodles I called them and was told that a replacement would be sent in 15 mins. Half an hour later I called again only to reach someone who initially had no idea about the case but on checking with the kitchen was told that the order is on its way and will reach in 10 mins. Another 25 mins later when I called again, this time to cancel, as the kids had already eaten, I was told that the order would reach soon and someone from the kitchen would call to explain. I am still waiting for that call. It might come in a few years. Mistakes do happen but the luke warm response and callous attitude to resolving the mistakes is what makes this whole experience disappointing. Careful while ordering -- be prepared to eat something that you may not have ordered or one person goes hungry while the others have eaten..",1.0

"FreshMenu is a great effort. We usually try to avoid home delivery as much as possible but when we do, Fresh Menu is usually what we go for. It's a fairly reliable option - there's usually good variety, food is mostly always good and fresh.",3.5

"The food menu is so refreshing, lives upto the name every time I order. Food quality so good I don't mind shelling out a little bit extra for my meal.",5.0
"Ordered Freshmenu today for the first time , highly impressed with the quality of food. All the ingredients were fresh , taste is very good, less spice, easy on stomach and a great value . Thanks Freshenu, keep it up ! It is difficult to find tasty food which are also healthy. The food does not feel heavy , feels perfectly balanced. Will definitely recommend to friends.",5.0
I frequently order from here.  The taste is always good.  But the delivery is usually delayed.  It takes minimum 1 hour to get the food delivered.  This requires a lot of pre planning.  Also the quantities are unpredictable.  Once I had serious concern about how fresh the food was because it carried a mild stale smell. You can try it at your own discretion.,3.0
- Food is tasty and feels fresh.,4.0
"I have been ordering from them for quite some time .They used to be good but now no more , the quality of food has deteriorated , the combinations don't go well and and there is absolutely no taste in the food. But the prices have gone up. Also,they have no sense of time , can keep the customer waiting for the order way beyond the stipulated time. Extremely disappointing. Hope they know that there is enough competition around.",2.0

"I like continental food and was ordering freshmenu for quite sometime. I must say that FreshMenu felt good initially but have slipped tremendously the later part. Firstly the item they deliver is not at all inline with the image they display. For e.g what are shown are grilled exotic veggies like carrots, broccoli on the side, but what is delivered is diced beetroot....Secondly their non-veg fish or chicken pieces are somewhat small and instead the amount of rice is huge....for the calories and protein conscious this ratio makes no sense and again here the item is not what it looks like in the menu...what is worse is the recent delays in delivery I faced, so much so that my order placed at 7:20 pm was not delivered until 9 pm...I called FreshMenu...and they said the person will be at my door step anytime....it was 10:00pm ....yet no one showed up....I called FreshMenu the next day...there was no apology....for completely not delivering the order...forget about late delivery....The FreshMenu call center executives lied to me with their false apologies...but did not do anything nor any commitment to deliver my order and even call the next day morning trying to explain what went wrong....So I ""Was"" a FreshMenu customer and I am sure I will never ever order FreshMenu again",2.0
Cant get better that good food at your door step.,5.0
"Like most food startups that lose the plot freshmenu joins the gang! It started off well but quality of ingredients as well as taste are reaching rock bottom with rubbery rolls, crumbling stale buns, patties with enough garlic powder to kill vampires for miles and diluted sauces and sides. Give this one a miss!!!",1.5
"Ordered Egyptian Dukkah Spiced Sliders (Veg) today. It was Bad. The bun was dry, Patty in one of the slider was dry too.",3.0
"When they started it was awesome world food at your door step.. It was my favorite takeout place. But now I'm guessing there was some kind of corporate take over. With which prices became high, quantity and quality both were compramised.. A lot!",2.5
"Like menu. Like food. Scrumptious scrumptious scrumptious. Was skeptical about the quantity they served still went on with ordering as this was pending since long. Was glad to see the portions they served. Thoughtful box packing. Thoughtful napkin spoon fork combo. Lightning fast delivery. Was totally flattered with the overall experience of food ordering, food appearance and the food taste. Happy to have you guys on sarjapur road. Stay delicious.",4.5

The menu looked delicious and so as the food was....The delivery was not bad as well...Overall experience was good ....Thank you freshmenu...,4.5
"This is a wonderful choice to have in your home delivery kitty, it is reasonably priced and the portion size is also adequate. The menu keeps changing everyday. We tried the honey glazed chicken,gremolata chicken and the Thai green curry , all of them were delicious. The menu lacks Indian dishes. On the whole it is worth a try and I would definitely order again.",4.5
Food is good and sends what is mentioned. Delicery is fast even during peak time with  orders of 5 to 10 people. Need to be watched for next few orders on the consistency.,4.0
"Ordered the so called ""hoisin glazed chicken"" today and it was very bad as the fried rice and chicken was soo dry and tasteless..big rip off. Fresh menu is fooling everyone with their marketing. It took an hour to get the bad food delivered...folks beware dont be a victim....",1.0
"Worried about the consistency of their orders. It has been twice that the order was not the same as shown on the site. Once the Greek Salad did not have black olives. And yesterday, Manakeesh with hummus and lebaneh had 2 servings of lebaneh with no hummus. Also, their support number is not reachable easily.¬†I think they need to be more thorough in their delivery.",4.0
"Quality is consistent across all the outlets of Freshmenu. I love the ingredients used by them. Recently, they have started addition of new items in menu. That allures me to visit their app quite oftenly.",3.5
I have been using Freshmenu for the past two weeks. Its convenient to order. Good variety of healthy food with a mixture of sweet indulgences.,4.0
"So after much delay, i ordered from freshmenu. I had concerns about quality n packaging coming from places whr such ventures run into quality n quantity issues. But freshmenu folks, thumbs up. You guys have serious attention to detail and that is what i love for my food. I wd hate to pay for good food in rubbish packaging. Anyway, the food was good and fresh. Wd love to order all other things from your menu. Good luck.",4.5

This place has been good to others hence I ordered from here!! To be very honest the burger was awful!! And so were the repercussions!! I've fallen sick with food poisoning since the last 2 days!! This place I don't advice you folks to eat at,1.0
Loved their spaghetti and meat balls we had ordered recently at a friends place. They deliver super fast too. I love that they serve good quantities of food that constitutes for a full meal for one person at a very reasonable price. Just that the masala was slightly too much. Like too much gravy on the spaghetti. They also give you a bun with it. My friend had ordered the herb rice and grilled chicken. The chicken was very dry and he really dint like it and ate most of my food instead that is the reason i am rating this slightly lower than i would have.,3.0
"Loved the food, ordered a couple of times and delivery has been prompt. The food is well packaged and ¬† each meal is complete with salads and sides.",4.0
"Extremely dissatisfied with today's order delivery, mostly cuz it never came !! I had ordered the Tex burger around 9:30 PM by 9:55 PM I receive an email that my order would be delivered in 30 mins. From 10:45 - 11:30 PM I've been continuously calling their customer support but none of them seem to respond, apparently they were ALL busy. I try to track my order and it shows that it has been shipped, so obviously the delivery guy never came nor did he bother to call and inform. And it was already paid for, all you guys had to do was bring the food. The sheer negligence from the people at freshmenu.com is very saddening.",1.0
"It was a delight, ordering from FreshMenu! The online process is lucid and straightforward. Though for sometime I haggled with phone number mentioned on Zomato, and finally gave up. For a lone dinner I ordered a Chermoula Grilled Chicken Salad & Smoky Chicken Vibe Sandwich. The salad was fresh and the sandwich was crisp. In a nutshell, I would recommend ordering from this place in case you are too lazy to cook on a lackadaisical weekend!The presentation, packaging and delivery time are praiseworthy too.",3.5
"They need to change dishes and ingredients.. Now all dishes, especially veg tastes same..Bland. Also, please bring up more options..most of the times they get repeated and soon it will lose it appeal if no different dishes are available.",3.0
I have been a fan of fresh menu but its the 2nd time they didnt delivery the food.,1.0
"Ordered the salt-and-pepper tofu and the citrusy noodle salad. The food reached exactly on time, a no-mean feat considering the terrible traffic ¬†on ORR. Very well-packaged and sensible containers. The Tofu was a little rubbery but the sauce and the beetroot appetiser(?) were spot-on. The noodle salad was quite enough for two people. Good value for money.",4.0
Have ordered from here three times and never been disappointed. Every dish tastes like it has been made with care. Food comes in good packaging.,4.5
Recommended by one of my friend.,4.5
"From the time I got to know that there is something like FreshMenu, It has become a daily habit for me to check dishes on app. Today in Sunday meal, I ordered TAPAS PLATTER... It was mind blowing. I strongly recommend that if you are seeing reviews today (12th July).... try it !! U will love this Spanish Cuisine.",4.5
"Husband's been wanting to try this for a long time - the food, ably advertised on all social media channels looks so appetising too! So, on a day when the family was generally cranky, u by decided to order.",3.5
Initially the food used to be v nice l but now both quality and quantity has reduced significantly,1.5
Nice service but the only problem is they rotate their menu everyday. I liked pasta but it didn't come again in the menu that's what I don't like..!,2.5
"After more than 30mins of ordering at 1030PM, i'm being told that the food can't be delivered..and all i'm offered is a cold 'sorry'. Leaving me without options at this hour. This was my first exp with Freshmenu and ofcourse would be the last too..ridiculous service and zero customer empathy!",1.0
I got to know about fresh menu from one of my friend and after that i have ordered here multiple times and good thing about them is there changing menu so everyday you will see something new.,4.0
"Had been a regular, however visible deterioration in food quality/taste. alas started off well, had hopes of them continue to do well. My last order has resulted in my 500bucks and no food delivered. on calling figured that the site payment gateway debited my account but didnt confirm delivery. havent got any response for my emails or calls....hope they pull themselves up",1.5
Worthless service. They deliver it for 2 days continously and the third day the just stop delivering food without any prior intimation. Not worth it. I had some friends visiting and was really embarrased because of this nonsense. Swear not to order from here again and would not recommend this to anyone.,1.0
"Freshmenu stands by its name. The menu options are interesting and different. Ordered their set of 3 small burgers. The concept was novel wherein u get to eat 3 different burgers, instead of one specific. And yes! It was yummy :) too.",4.0
"They say what you see in photo is what you get, this is utter rubbish. Veg Hakka noodle looked green with some sort of masala and veggies in it, besides that on their website they had Asian BBQ Chicken Noodle Mania which was whitish I strongly believe they sent me those noodles. Noodles were bland in taste just plain salted",1.0

"Food quality, taste, packaging, Android app is really good. I have ordered from here many times over the last couple of months. The only problem seems to be delivery time. It always takes more than an hour and the food could be warmer. Am not expecting a Dominos 30 minute delivery but 45-50 mins at the most or a phone call saying your food will be late is appreciated. When you call them after an hour, they say the food has already left the place and should be there and the food arrives after another 10-15 minutes.",3.0

"Ive just read the expert reviews, and most of them have given ratings above 4. So I'm very confused. I mean, I've ordered twice from here, the first time it was a chicken steak. Bad. Second time were very mediocre chicken burgers, each for a whooping 250Rs. I'm surprised by the fact that Fresh Menu has just good reviews.. Maybe i'll get 3rd time lucky eh?",2.5

"noticed this app while browsing thru Facebook. The items prepared are not Indian and hence this came across as a novel service to me. Liked most of the items tried and i have been placing an order at least 4 times a week last month.

"This is now just another food offering in Bangalore which started off decent but has turned pathetic recently. I have placed a few orders on FreshMenu (Indira Nagar) but had very bad experiences in my last couple of orders. One of my orders was delayed by 2 hours and I had to follow up with them several times to get it delivered. There was not a single call from them to explain the reason for the delay. The other time I placed an order for a salad I asked the dressing to be given separately and they refused saying they don‚Äôt do customizations. They used to provide the dressing separately in 2-3 occasions I ordered before. Calling this is a customization is ridiculous. Based on the tone of the person who I spoke with, it looks like they don‚Äôt care about what the customers want anymore and it‚Äôs up to the customers to take what they give. Providing good service only for a couple of weeks after you start won‚Äôt take you anywhere. There are too many better options in Bangalore. I have already placed my last order with them.",1.0
"Ah the rise and fall of Freshmenu. Almost Orwellian really, in an Animal Farm kind of way.",2.5
It was ¬†great initially. Now its just ¬†deteriorating day by day. They publicize all day menu but that ¬†start only after 12 (that too written somewhere in small dull font). Why not popup the delivery timings before taking the order. No notification even after the order to know when will be the delivery.,1.0
"My go-to site whenever I am craving for something different. I stumbled upon the site accidentally and I am thankful I did. A new menu everyday with such different and delectable items. I have tried so many dishes here. Be it a noodle box, Mexican sliders, varieties of salads, etc. each and every dish is fulfilling and yum. As I am writing this review, I am waiting for another dish I have ordered from their site. I am happy with their service and I recommend everyone to give it a try. You will love it.",4.5

"Got a discount coupon code with today's TOI. Ordered via mobile app. And there's no place to apply the coupon! Called up the customer care. Got a strange reply. Coupon only applicable online! How wired. And by the way, the app doesn't take my previously registered account details. Had to register again via mobile app. And last week when I ordered, instead of chicken dish came a veg dish! Not sure it's just me or someone else faced such issues. Nevertheless, the menu maybe fresh everyday but the service is still good ol' style. Tsk tsk... Not expected.",1.5

"Initially I really liked the concept and the food. However, their service has been very poor. On a number of occasions I have received my food after an hour and a half, and there have been incidents like the food being delivered to the wrong address. They even sent me the wrong food item and when I refused to pay the money they sent the manager all the way to make sure I pay the money. This is not how you treat your customers especially when a startup is in its developmental stage. I've even got uncooked chicken. The customer care is very poor,most of the times they don't receive the calls. After getting a 30 cr funding they have become stingy, that is ironic. The packaging of the sandwiches was more convenient earlier. Earlier, they used to give a huge quantity of mayonaisse along with the sandwiches and now they just give two delmonte sauce packets without mayo. Very disappointed. I really liked them in the beginning. But now they have become VERY MEDIOCRE.",2.0

The worst experience one can have. Ordered for mid sized 200 ppl event and got half cooked rice. The amount of food that got wasted was criminal.

Freshmenu has the worst possible delivery service. They should add a disclaimer on their website saying that it is going to take them 2 hours to prepare the food and that even after 2 hours you will have to spend an additional half hour trying to make the delivery guy understand simple directions. The owner of this company really needs to look into his company...seems like he/she is pretty content with whatever little freshmenu has achieved so far!! Terrible service!,1.0
Very nice food.. My friend ordered it for me. I just loved it.. And especially I need not go to the restaurants to eat it. I can comfortably eat it at home as they deliver it at home.,4.5

Little cheesy tangy pasta with awesome good 3 slices of fish.Ordering food from them is hassle free and quick service and hot food.

"Those pictures on the website ARE REAL! When they say vegetarian, they mean business. There were fresh, abundant veggies present in the Thai yellow curry.

There were red, yellow and green bell peppers, big chunks of them, and succulent slices of zucchini (yeah, meat eaters, zucchini CAN be succulent too!) and carrots and spring onions and mushrooms and broccoli(green, not the 3 day old brown-head). And the curry had the zing from galangal. And then the potato wedges that come as a side with the sandwiches. Aah! I could eat a bucketfull of those. The mousse wasnt disappointing either.",4.5

Ordered from freshmenu twice now.... First delivery was very prompt...Even though it was a weekend the delivery happened in 35-40mins.... The quantity is also good for the price offered....tasty food served hot... second time we ordered it during weekday.... It took close to two hours to deliver after the order was placed even though it was mentioned in the email it would just take 20mins once shipped..... Had to call up thr customer care to follow up... Overall very satisfied with the food taste n quantity.... Can improve in the delivery aspects....,3.5
"I placed an order at 12:06 pm today. Its 1:50 pm now. Neither the food is delivered nor i have recieved an order number in my cell.

Even after making me hold the call for 10 minutes , the customer care team could not track my order. ¬†I have been a regular customer this week as the food has been fairly nice. But getting my lunch delivered at the snack time is not a great idea. Completely disappointed. I will definitely hesitate to place another order with Freshmenu.com... Extremely poor customer service.

Internatiinal cusine with limited options and quality food. Presentation is good and the daily new menu makes us log in atleast once on the website and order fav food.

"I was not disappointed after my first order at FreshMenu yesterday. They delivered pretty much as promised. The food was tasty and also appealing to the eye. The daily change in the menu is an interesting concept and also helps them to keep their operational worries to the minimum because the everyday menu is limited and they only need to take care of the 6-7 items on offer for the day. I would say its a smart strategy which works both for the customer and the organisation. A few suggestions - Marking for veg/non veg has to be very clear. Could be denoted by green/red dot. Some of the salads and desserts are not very clear in these terms. Eg,""Summer Cooler Salad"" doesn't mention whether it is veg or non veg. Similarly ""Mocha Walnut Mousse"" could have eggs but one would not know. I hope they can take care of these simple things.",4.0

Ordered a Balsamic Grilled Chicken (with salad & pasta), a Thai Fish Green Curry (with cottage cheese & rice) and Harissa chicken skewers. The actual food looked as good as it did on the website.

Quality of food is detiorating day by day. Last time I ordered chicken was not properly cooked. I still ordered again yesterday; placed order at 8:10pm and was waiting till 9:30pm and then started calling them. Their phone was either busy or not reachable. Finally spoke with someone at 9:45 pm who said my order has left kitchen and is on the way. Again at 10:15pm I got a call from them saying they cannot process my order.

"My delightful experience with Freshmenu team started on a ¬†lazy Saturday, when I neither wanted to go out to eat nor wanted to cook, but certainly had great appetite and craved for some good food. Thats when I remembered the pamphlet I had received one day along with my newspaper,. thought of trying it out. And believe you me...that was the start to an eternal blissful journey with yummy authentic good food..USP of Freshmenu is the authenticity of the dishes they offer each day and it varies every single day. What you see in the picture is exactly what you get on the plate when it is delivered. Their packing is so clean and hygienic. Food is always fresh. My family and friends have now become officially the regular customers of this place and we certainly will spread the good word, because good things deserve good publicity to become more successful. Its a new venture and I really hope and pray that they keep delighting their customers(of course, me!!!) always. Another thing to notice is the behaviour of the guys who pick up your call when you call them or even the delivery boys- they have perfected the art of customer service...Way to go guys Freshmenu!!!",5.0

"I heard how tasty the Freshmenu food is, I even got a glimpse of how it looks like, but I never got to taste it until yesterday. I ordered chicken stuffed with cheese and spinach, a fruit salad and two different mousse desserts. The chicken was my absolute favorite! It simply tasted like in a gourmet restaurant in Europe, a feeling I totally missed while in India. The balance of flavors was spot on! Nothing was in excess, just the best mix for an exceptional taste! It exceeded my expectations, which were already high after all the great feedback I got to hear from my friends who tried Freshmenu before. The mousse desserts were also above what you usually get in Indian restaurants. Again, a balanced flavor, not excessively sweet, and a lovely pinch of fresh nuts, raisins, coconut, fruits etc. depending on the flavor you choose. I went for a banana + nuts/raisins I think and a light strawberry + coconut, if I am not wrong (I do not recall their exact name from the menu). The fruit salad was alright (I think all fruit salads are more or less just cut fruits, so slightly difficult to compare this one). Overall, I finished my plate in under 10 minutes, haha, enjoyed my dinner tremendously and based on my last-night chicken experience I already target today's ravioli stuffed with spinach and cheese. If it tastes just as delicious as the chicken I might soon disemploy my home-cook or send her to train at Freshmenu. :))",5.0
Love this concept of home delivered food with every day changing menu. I have tried it twice and have truly liked everything it ate.,5.0
"The quirkiness of the idea of an ever changing menu got me intrigued. Only delivery too. While we had many restaurants providing food with home delivery, this concept is literally fresh and new. We ordered a balsamic chicken with a creamy sauce, chicken in pepper sauce and a Caesars salad. ¬†Loved the service from the follow up call to the boys who delivered - very friendly. The food was hot unlike other restaurants (which serves in plastic containers) and coming in various temperatures, packed in compartmentalised containers with quirky delightful packaging. The food was delicately flavoured with the right amount of ingredients ¬†and done just right! The salad tasted just as good as anywhere we have had. The food was without a doubt delectable! The portion size was also correct and the pricing is just right! On the whole it was great experience (when I least expected it!). The only negative is I check the menu everyday now for the new items!",5.0
"Have ordered twice from this place. Food is amazing !!! Its fresh, perfectly balanced flavor and delivered hot. FreshMenu makes continental dishes affordable without compromising the taste and quality. Moroccan stuffed chicken with herb rice was absolutely worth every penny, it was delicious and very light on stomach. I am not a dessert person, but banana and raisin mousse changed my mood to instant happiness, it melted in my mouth and it was not so sweet just the perfect amount of sweet for not so dessert fan.

"Why do I love this place? Is the concept? Is it the food itself? Is it their website ? Or is it their customer service? I think all of the above. Freshmenu comes as a breath of fresh air in the home delivery scene with them coming up with a new menu everyday. Pretty self explanatory. They have main course(veg and non veg), salads(veg and non veg) and a few desserts. I love the idea of not looking at a long list and being equally confused everyday and instead have a choice of a few good dishes to pick from. We ordered an oriental salad, a mustard grilled chicken and vegetables in black bean sauce with noodles. The food is delivered quick and hot and the packing is a delight. The chicken was served with a portion of rice and salad and was perfectly done in this lovely sauce. I couldn't taste a lot of mustard in it but I am not complaining as long as it is yum. The noodles were a perfect accompaniment for the vegetable in black bean sauce. Both the dishes were mildly seasoned and a welcome relief from the more saucy version elsewhere. The salad however, was a let down and tasted funny. But on mentioning this to the establishment they were gracious enough to send us a new salad and a chocolate mousse cake complimentary! The salad was a chicken and white peas salad which is light yet filling and leaves you with zero guilt. I have been checking their website almost everyday and they have some very dishes like Cajun spiced fish, Waldorf salad, cannelloni verdure( which is a pasta filled with cottage cheese and veggies) and cinnamon braised chicken. All in all FreshMenu is delightful in its variety , very reasonably priced and definitely on your to check list next time you are hungry!",4.0

"Tried a meal from Freshmenu.com food delivery and turned out to be a great experience. Packing was neat, food inside the container looked mouth watering  and tasted delicious. Some of my colleagues had a taste of the deliciousness and they loved it too. No more boring same old menu!!! With FreshMenu, i can try new cuisine everyday : ) I am sure of ordering more. Thank you :)",4.0
"Pleasantly surprised... gourmet meal, quality package, variety of distinct menu to choose from and spot on home delivery but less portions. Quite pricey for the small-scale portions of the main course, but would like to try different dishes in the menu. Definitely would recommend to try it!",4.0
"They have got a really nice concept and is worth trying once, at least. They have a ‚Äòfresh menu‚Äô every other day and it was one of those days when I wanted to have something different. I ordered ‚ÄòMongolian Tofu and Fried Rice‚Äô. I ordered online and the order was delivered within 40-45 minutes. The taste is superb and it gives you the luxury of trying something different (when you are in no mood to have anything from your traditional list of choices). Food is nicely cooked and served hot too (thanks to the quick delivery). The pricing is, considering the quantity offered, on a higher side. A couple would need to order at least 3 items from the list for a decent dinner/lunch meal. Hence, I would shy away from qualifying it as a full meal.",3.5
"A foodie friend of mine suggested this delivery option when I was on the verge of being tired of the quality of food home delivered by normal restaurant chains and I am glad he did. Freshmenu specializes in delivery of gourmet food so they got a chance to concentrate totally on that aspect so as to make it a pleasant experience to have food from containers at home instead of a fancy restaurant. They made sure the packaging dint compromise on the quality too and it made it possible for the smell of the food to stay contained till we open the box ourselves. When I opened my box which had Lemongrass and Coriander fish with wasabi, all my senses kick started to take in the delicate lemongrass aroma which the dish managed to contain. The dish itself looked pleasing and a pleasant change from the usual home delivered food I get. Since it was fish, it won me over but honestly, it was cooked to perfection and it was quite warm and dint get cold as we usually expect. The wasabi tasted really good with the rice and fish but I would have preferred smaller size of the cut vegetables. Well, all is forgiven when the taste is amazing. I thought that it would be less filling when I saw the contents in the box but by the time I finished my meal, I was very full and I still had a complimentary chocolate mousse waiting to be had. Although I always have a separate place in my stomach for desserts :D The mousse was very light in texture and it was a bit mild in taste but the cocoa garnish seemed a bit bitter and spoiled the taste. It could have been better but it might be one time thing too. Anyways, this deal for 250 bucks is quite reasonable considering the quality of the food they deliver and I am quite happy that I tried it out and I plan to order in again. :)",4.0
"This is just amazing, order food for just 250 bucks n evvvry damn day d menu changes so i tink v can make a living with their food ‚úåÔ∏è pretty reasonable! Want this to get famous so dat evrybdy is at peace with food ????",5.0

"I was going through 'just delivery' collection of zomato. I found this place which do not have a fixed menu, it changes every day. Quite distinct ! You can order food on freshmenu.com . They have 4-5 dishes every day like burger, pasta, noodles. We ordered veg burger & smoothie, penne with olives and peppers in tomato sauce and mango colada. Veg patty was filling and pasta was superb. Our ordered came in well packed boxes with some fruit salad( please give fresh fruit next time). Food was moderately hot but on time. You will be amazed by the kind of arrangement of parcel in delivery boy's bag. Mango colada, highly not recommended, it tastes like a sweet powdery shake. We got free chocolate mousse as there was a offer if your order exceeds 300, you get a free dessert. The food was bit expensive but will definitely order next time for something new on menu !!",3.5

"While the concept of a restaurant that does home delivery is not new (and there are quite a few of them around), what was exceptional was the quality of the food. A small menu that changes daily allows them to focus on and create really tasty food instead of having a menu with a 100 items on them with no discernable taste. For once, the pictures of the food on the website matched what we got. Good packaging, good delivery time and good quantities. The prices are¬†pretty reasonable¬†and a good value for money. What I missed (entirely my fault) was to apply the discount coupon promotion that would have given us one item free.¬†Will definitely be ordering from them again in the near future.",4.5

"Well what do you know. The hottest food startup in Bangalore, one I was eager to try, made me want to throw the neatly packed box straight into the trash - food into the degradable one and plastic into the recyclable can. This because my very first order for¬†a 3 salad serving¬†was a stinky, barf-inducing mess. Credit where it's due: 1. They did try to replace one promptly¬†but it took half an hour to get to me by which time I'd lost my appetite. They also did call up to apologise which I think is an effort worth appreciating. 2. The ordering system is something I thought was quite neat. The app showed where the delivery guy was while in transit and the payment part were a breeze. Quality of packaging also was good and it's thoughtful of them to include a fork, spoon and tissue with every order. Unfortunately, today, the consensus in the office is unanimous.¬†The quality of food is going down like crazy. There were few¬†cases last week of stale/unpalatable food being served with stomach churning results. No one wants to try it out. To make it worse the other players are not even worth mentioning. It's a shame that the predictable behaviour of a usual office caterer, great for a week and horrible there-after, is happening with FreshMenu too. I had great hopes there. My gold standard for consistency is still¬†the humble¬†darshini around the corner. Any corner i.e.",1.0

"Ordered pasta with chicken , chicken steak sandwich and pan fried noodles with sweet and sour veggies this time and was highly disappointed .. The only saving grace was the sandwich which tasted real nice .. Pan fried noodles were inedible and went straight into the dustbin ( sorry for such a harsh comment but really it did not live up to the Taste and was really really low quality ) . The grilled chicken with the pasta was cooked well but there was no taste at all completely bland .. Also it was just boiled pasta ( not really al dente) and the watery mushroom sauce was poured on it .. Had ordered it for lunch ( a friend was visiting ) and was all praise about the food as I had really good experience how're you guys really disappointed me this time ..  The concept and the packaging is great but the food taste has to improve .. It should not taste like airline food .. Will now only stick to the desserts and sandwiches next time .. Cheers",2.5

"So we ordered from much talked FreshMenu.com for tonight's dinner. Since its a lazy Sunday and raining we thought it's best we order. The app is much reliable but, needed more work on it. Like getting option to track our order and also should have a option to add or less toppings for particular dishes. We ordered Teriyaki Grilled Fish, Lamb Vindaloo Rice Bowl,  BBQ Chicken Mega Burger, Caramelized Steak Sandwich, Thai-spiced Chicken Wings around 8PM and due to rain the delivery was delayed but I don't wanna complaint about it. But lack of taking ownership about such situations like either a call or text message notifying about the delay. So that how delayed deliver. Now comes to the food which was packed so well and tidy- thumbs up to that. I fell in love the mega burger and thai-chicken wings - yummy filling, giant chicken patty and it's a toothsome. But the lamb and fish were cooked well but it was over salted which killed the dishes, it was a disappointment. But, sure I shall try another time again and see how it comes up all  together.",4.0

"Was great initially, but the quality is going down the drain slowly but surely. I understand the delivery times getting affected because of the growing popularity. But nowadays it seems all the meals are put together hastily and haphazardly. I recently got a fried rice with rice and the fried veggies separate from each other!",2.5
Have ordered few times and worth mentioning is the service of delivery. Great choice of food somedays. Taste is good enough to repeat ordering. Need to see how it continues. Last 2 times the quality and quantity were inconsistent.,3.5

Even after i get a message that order is out for delivery,  it never turns up.  on top of that,  no response to phone or email.  Pathetic service.",1.0
Easy to order with daily changing menu. Have tried sandwiches and salads - both veg and non veg. Good on taste and quality. No issues with delivery.,3.5
We've ordered from here for a month. But today they just decided they don't want to deliver to some parts of Whitefield anymore and cancelled our order without informing us! Was waiting hungry for 2 hours before I called them and THEN they tell me that they cancelled my order! It was so late that it severely reduced my options of ordering from other places. Horrible customer service! Think twice before considering this as a reliable option.,1.0
"Finally got to taste freshmenu. Ordered online, simple steps. Rcvd mail confirmation. Was hesitant if delivery person will find way as other restaurants don't find way after reapeted instruction, but without a call was at my door. Now the food, had ordered a salad n fish main course. Salad tasted fresh, crunchy, in the main course wow it was a full stomach meal. Enjoyed every bit of it. Quantity is sumptuous n tastes great.",5.0
"I like idea of having a different menu everyday. The customer doesn't get bored with the same old menu. This said, I have ordered a lot from fresh menu.The food looks great and seems to be fresh as they claim but there is a weird after taste in all of their food items, making you wonder whether their food is fresh or not. And no, I am not talking about the cut vegetables they give on the side.",2.5
Tried Fresh Menu for the first time yesterday. The taste and quality of the food is great. Good portion as well. Had Thai Veg curry and Cheese Cake. Vegetables used are fresh and salads taste amazing. I wasn't really expecting it to be so good. Price is a little on the higher side. Menu changes daily. Would suggest them to have more varieties for both veg and non veg. Great food. Keep up the good work.,4.0

The delivery guy insisted I take the wrong item and he forgot to get disposable cutleries. The final order came 40 minutes later. I have emailed Freshmenu but no response. The android app as well doesn't sync with the account. The service is bad and the tech matches it.,3.0

Have been ordering from fresh menu for quite some time. Here are the differentiators:,4.0
"I have been ordering from Freshmenu for quite some time now and I really love some of their dishes. The only feedback that I would have is that they should introduce a few Indian Dishes and also add more varieties. Their Lamb Thai Massaman Curry was great, however I do not see it feature on the menu regularly.",3.5
"Love, Love the service. good and quality food served at your door step. Super convenient app and website to help you order. two thumbs up :)",4.5
"Regular from Freshmenu.. Wide range of continental food.. Amazing food.. Freshness of the ingredients is amazing. COttage Cheese, Fish, chicken and the croquettes... All superb... The Desserts are real authentic taste with mild sweetness which lasts.. Definitely one of the best... Another amazing feature is the packaging.. Brilliant..",1.0
"The app is really convenient, light and it just simply works. It hardly took me 5 mins to order and another 45 for it to reach home. It came a bit cold though, but you can always microwave it.",3.5
"Definite go to option for home delivery. Wonderful taste, easy/hassle-free app for ordering, quick delivery and a good menu each day. What more could one ask for :) haven't seen anyone I know complain about this service and I am just another satisfied customer. Keep up the good work.",4.5
"Disappointing service. Food came cold, soggy. Customer care interaction was poor too. I liked the quality in first order i placed but its a declining graph both in terms of service and quality, not mentioning quantity as i expected it too be less.",1.0
"Ordered first tym.  I would like to say this is simple awesome. Taste,quality,quantity is very good. It was packed very beautifully. Delivered in 30 mins. Great",4.5
Got my order delivered within 5 minutes of placing the order and their sandwiches are really fresh and tasty! Yet to try the other mains.¬†Best part is that the menu is new everyday!,4.5
Fresh menu is a great initiative. A smart idea to serve continental food with good packing and fast delivery time. The food on its own is weak at times. I have been served stale pasta on a couple of occasions because of which I hesitate to order much from this place. This place has a lot of potential to be much more than it is. The menu gets repetitive at times.,2.5
"Been reading great rave views of FreshMenu so said ""why not give it a go""?",3.5
I tried their choco chip cookies today; just one word - horrendous! It tastes eggy and downright disgusting! Their stuff is normally pretty good but as far as the cookies go - stay away!,1.0
Freshmenu is a fresh concept and a very good one.,4.5
Great food at affordable prices. Love the new menus everyday. Delivery is great. Keep up the standard. I would suggest adding a selection of soft drinks to your menu.,4.5
Horrible experience dear investor who invested in freshmenu you made a huge gamble....I THINK THEY MAKE THE FOOD USING PHOTOSHOP ..please see the desert I got today to what was posted on the website!!,1.0
"Freshmenu was indeed a breath of fresh air to me when I first heard about them. For a continental food lover like me it was just the thing I needed - simple bites, good portions, quick delivery and easy on the pocket. Introduced to it by a friend, I have now become a regular. What I like the best in the ever changing menu are the sandwiches and salads. They are usually never off the mark. The mains though are not very consistent when it comes to quality and taste and usually fall short of the desired mark. Also, their app needs a revamp. I wonder how the developers have missed out on the most important aspect - feedback! Also one cannot see past orders. As far as the service is concerned all their delivery people hand over the ordered items with a smile on faces. I don't know if this is one of the instructions or just comes naturally but it's a good thing nonetheless. But cannot say the same for their customer care. Most of the times they don't pick up. Even if they do they are not much of a help (one of the reps sounded rude as well). All in all even though there's definite scope for improvement it is a good start-up and I hope they break even real soon.",3.5
So this is a online thing where they keep updating their menu and you can order it online . Quiet an interesting concept . Brownie points for the thought .,3.0
"Reducing my rating as they have gone down on the quality of food,  reduced the quantity and also are not exploring enough variety as was the case before.. I see several items being repeated in very short intervals.. Food served isn't as great as it used to be when they first started operations and I was a very big fan but not at all satisfied with where they are heading..",3.5
Love it...the array of cuisines available is amazing. The food is always fresh and their lip smacking dips are an added bonus. Will definitely recommend to people seeking continental food in the comforts of their homes.,4.5

"Worst ever experience for food delivery in Bangalore. I placed my order at 7:30 in the evening and got an update that the food is out for delivery. Even got a call from the delivery guy for delivery address confirmation. But after that I have no clue where my food disappeared in thin air. After constantly trying delivery guy's number and freshmenus' phone, the guy in the restaurant finally answered @9pm. He apologised and asked for 10mins to figure out the delivery. And as expected he never replied back and the food never reached me. To top it all, next day the delivery guy sends me a text msg ""who is it?""",1.0
It was just one of those lazy weekdays after work were you wanted food to conveniently come to you without any struggle. Freshmenu achieved that quite well for me. The concept of this place is simple and very efficient and they really do live up to there name because the food indeed does taste very fresh.,4.0
Amazing food worth the price and the quantity is also amaZing. My weekend is incomplete without having food from fresh menu. Keep it up guys!,5.0
"One of the best quality, healthy and tasty home delivery service ever in Bangalore. I used to Order 4-5 times a week from here and delivery happens in <30 mins all the time. Happy with their salad subscription too... Healthy dose of proteins & fiber everyday after a workout. Like clockwork I get a great salad everyday at 6. All they need to do is improve upon their desert variety and doesn't lose on great customer service while scaling ops. >> last statement become true. Quality went down & salads r terrible nowadays",3.5
Amazingly delicious. Beautiful package! I tried steamed fish and grilled chicken.. Not giving it 5 only because I had a tough time guiding the delivery guys to home.,4.5

"One of the best things that online ordering has to offer. Lately I have been experimenting a lot with ordering in because of the steep rise of online services and fresh menu tops the list. The food almost always looks like the photos on the site. It tastes pretty good, excellent portions and value for money. Love the packaging, the food is always hot and fresh! And to top it all the little dessert to order in the end are such a delight.",4.5
"Horrible experience. Please do not order from here. What was delivered was 2 hours late and not even what had been ordered for. Placed an order and had paid for it in advance. Waited an hour and relentlessly tried to get to customer support, who, of course did not pick up. When they finally did, what i had ordered for was no longer available and they sent something else. They did not even call me to check if I wanted to change the order. Also, called several times to check when the new order will arrive and got no response to the question. In fact, they refused to answer the question. Colossal waste of time.",1.0
Seeing the ratings of this place on Zomato got me curious. I ordered a chicken caeser salad to work and I received it within half hour! The salad was really good! Good quantities of veggies and chicken and the dressing was generous! Well worth the price!,4.5
"Very bad and unprofessional experience. Placed an order which was not delivered within 45 mins, contacted the customer support but no resolution was provided, wasted 15 mins to try and resolve the delivery problem. Took another 5 mins to cancel the order. Overall a harrowing and time wasting experience for a working professional. No good places to eat nearby so was depending upon FreshMenu. Going for lunch at the last minute was another time waster.",1.0
"Ordered food after reading great reviews but guess I wasn't that lucky. Food did not turn up at all. Kept calling their number and  got a canned response stating "" we are busy ,but your call is important . we will call you back. "". Call never came. Will never try again.",1.0

We often order food on Sundays and have exhausted most of the options available in Whitefield. My friend told me about freshmenu.com . An only online food delivery service.

Would love it even more if they could give a little more gravy with the rice items.This concept is going to go big, please don't change anything! Some online bugs cause issues in ordering online sometimes. I'm sure they'll be working on it. For the phone- there is too much background noise while talking from the other end. Favourite part? The delivery time! So prompt and so accurate! Never more than 45 mins. Would love to know more about how this concept came up and the person behind it!

This delivery service has a daily changing menu system. You'll find a new menu everyday. As of now, I've tried their Chicken Salad, BBQ Chicken Sandwich, Fish Fingers, Spinach Cottage Cheese & Walnut Ravioli (Veg). All of these items were very fresh and hot when they were delivered.

Heard about it at work as continental food at medium prices...I thought maybe they compromise on the taste and boy was i wrong! Ordered the parsley crusted fish (I think it was basa)... Perfectly cooked and I couldn't find anything wrong with the tomato basil pasta either...that was one of the items on the menu that day...for dessert there was ""Gulkand Conde"" ...it was simple, easy to look at and tasty too! I will keep ordering every weekend now and would urge others too! Its worth it!",4.5

Starter (Barbecue Cottage cheese) was equally well prepared. The Packing was excellent and the food was not even touching the container lid.
